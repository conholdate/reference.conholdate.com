## Introduction

Dynamic animations can significantly enhance your presentations, making them more engaging and visually appealing. With Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can easily control after-animation effects, allowing you to create interactive experiences for your audience. This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the process of manipulating these effects in your slides.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming.
- The Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed. Download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
- An integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.

## Import Namespaces

To access the necessary Aspose.Slides functionalities, include the following namespaces in your code:

```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Slides.Animation;
using Aspose.Slides.SlideShow;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory

Start by ensuring the directory for your documents exists. If not, create it:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
if (!Directory.Exists(dataDir))
    Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```

## Step 2: Define Output File Path

Specify the output file path for your modified presentation:

```csharp
string outPath = Path.Combine(dataDir, "AnimationAfterEffect-out.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Load the Presentation

Load your existing presentation using the `Presentation` class:

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "AnimationAfterEffect.pptx"))
```

## Step 4: Modify After Animation Effects on Slide 1

Clone the first slide and set its after-animation effect to "Hide on Next Mouse Click":

```csharp
ISlide slide1 = pres.Slides.AddClone(pres.Slides[0]);
ISequence seq = slide1.Timeline.MainSequence;
foreach (IEffect effect in seq)
    effect.AfterAnimationType = AfterAnimationType.HideOnNextMouseClick;
```

## Step 5: Modify After Animation Effects on Slide 2

Clone the first slide again, changing the after-animation effect to "Color" with a green hue:

```csharp
ISlide slide2 = pres.Slides.AddClone(pres.Slides[0]);
seq = slide2.Timeline.MainSequence;
foreach (IEffect effect in seq)
{
    effect.AfterAnimationType = AfterAnimationType.Color;
    effect.AfterAnimationColor.Color = Color.Green;
}
```

## Step 6: Modify After Animation Effects on Slide 3

For the third slide, set the after-animation effect to "Hide After Animation":

```csharp
ISlide slide3 = pres.Slides.AddClone(pres.Slides[0]);
seq = slide3.Timeline.MainSequence;
foreach (IEffect effect in seq)
    effect.AfterAnimationType = AfterAnimationType.HideAfterAnimation;
```

## Step 7: Save the Modified Presentation

Finally, save your modified presentation:

```csharp
pres.Save(outPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully learned how to control after-animation effects on slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Feel free to experiment with different effects to create dynamic and engaging presentations that captivate your audience.
