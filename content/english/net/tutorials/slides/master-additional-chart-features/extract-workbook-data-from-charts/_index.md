## Introduction

Working with PowerPoint presentations can be challenging, especially when extracting valuable data from embedded charts. Fortunately, Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a robust solution that simplifies this process. In this tutorial, we'll guide you step-by-step on how to recover a workbook from a chart within a PowerPoint presentation.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, make sure you have the following ready:

### Aspose.Slides for .NET

You need to have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed in your development environment. If you haven't done this yet, you can download it from the website:

[Download Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/)

### PowerPoint Presentation

Have your PowerPoint presentation file handy, specifically one that contains a chart with associated data you wish to recover.

## Step 1: Import Necessary Namespaces

To work effectively with Aspose.Slides, you'll first need to import the required namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```

## Step 2: Define the Document Directory

Specify the directory where your presentation file is located:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Adjust this path as needed
```

## Step 3: Load the Presentation

You can load the PowerPoint presentation while enabling workbook recovery from the chart's cache. Here's how to do it:

```csharp
string pptxFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "YourPresentation.pptx");
string outPptxFile = Path.Combine(RunExamples.OutPath, "RecoveredWorkbook.pptx");

LoadOptions lo = new LoadOptions();
lo.SpreadsheetOptions.RecoverWorkbookFromChartCache = true;

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFile, lo))
{
    // Access and work with the chart data
    // Your code will go here
    pres.Save(outPptxFile, SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

In this step, the `LoadOptions` object allows you to enable workbook recovery using the `RecoverWorkbookFromChartCache` property.

## Step 4: Retrieve the Chart and Access Its Workbook

Now it's time to dig into the chart and retrieve its associated data:

```csharp
IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0] as IChart; // Adjust the index as needed
IChartDataWorkbook wb = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

// Now you can work with the workbook data as per your requirement
```

By accessing the first slide's first shape (which is expected to be a chart), you obtain the chart data workbook and can manipulate or extract the data as needed.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to effectively recover a workbook from a chart in a PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET. By following these steps, you can easily extract and utilize chart data for your analytical needs.
