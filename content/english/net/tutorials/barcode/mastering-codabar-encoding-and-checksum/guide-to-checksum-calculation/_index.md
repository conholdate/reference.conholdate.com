## Introduction

Codabar is a popular linear barcode symbology widely utilized across various industries for its simplicity and efficiency in labeling and identification. One critical feature of Codabar is its checksum calculation, which helps ensure the accuracy and integrity of the encoded data. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to calculate and generate Codabar barcodes with different checksum types using Aspose.BarCode for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following setup:

1. Aspose.BarCode for .NET: Make sure you have this library installed in your development environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/net/).
   
2. C# Development Environment: Have a C# IDE (like Visual Studio) ready for development.


## Importing Necessary Namespaces

To work with Aspose.BarCode, start by importing the required namespace at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.BarCode.Generation;
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Barcode Generator

You’ll want to initialize the Barcode Generator specifically for the Codabar symbology. Don’t forget to replace `"Your Directory Path"` with the directory path where you want the barcode images saved.

```csharp
string path = "Your Directory Path";
System.Console.WriteLine("Codabar Checksum Examples:");

BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Codabar, "-12345-");
```

## Step 2: Generate Codabar Barcode Without Checksum

First, let's create a Codabar barcode without any checksum. This is done by setting the checksum option to `None`.

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Pixels = 2; // Set the width of the bars
gen.Parameters.Barcode.IsChecksumEnabled = EnableChecksum.Default; // No checksum
gen.Save($"{path}CodabarChecksumNone.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Step 3: Generate Codabar Barcode with Mod10 Checksum

Next, we’ll generate a Codabar barcode that includes a Mod10 checksum, which enhances data integrity.

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.IsChecksumEnabled = EnableChecksum.Yes; // Enable checksum
gen.Parameters.Barcode.Codabar.CodabarChecksumMode = CodabarChecksumMode.Mod10; // Set Mod10
gen.Save($"{path}CodabarChecksumMod10.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Step 4: Generate Codabar Barcode with Mod16 Checksum

Finally, let’s produce a Codabar barcode that utilizes a Mod16 checksum, suitable for applications that demand higher accuracy.

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.IsChecksumEnabled = EnableChecksum.Yes; // Enable checksum
gen.Parameters.Barcode.Codabar.CodabarChecksumMode = CodabarChecksumMode.Mod16; // Set Mod16
gen.Save($"{path}CodabarChecksumMod16.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Conclusion

You’ve now successfully generated Codabar barcodes with different checksum types using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. These checksums are essential for maintaining the integrity of the encoded data, ensuring that the information scannable is both accurate and reliable.
