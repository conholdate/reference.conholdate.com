## Introduction

When building .NET applications that require barcode generation—such as for inventory management or retail—having precise control over the barcode’s properties can be crucial. Aspose.BarCode for .NET is a robust toolkit that allows you to customize your barcodes easily, including the ability to adjust their height. In this guide, we will provide you with a step-by-step process for modifying the height of a one-dimensional barcode using Aspose.BarCode.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core.
- The Aspose.BarCode for .NET library, which can be downloaded [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/net/).
- A code editor of your choice to write and run your code.

## Getting Started

We’ll begin by importing the necessary namespaces required for working with Aspose.BarCode.

### Importing Namespaces

Add the following using directive to your code file:

```csharp
using Aspose.BarCode.Generation;
```

## Step 1: Define Your Directory Path

Establish a directory path where you want to save your generated barcode images. Make sure to replace "Your Directory Path" with an actual path on your system:

```csharp
string path = @"C:\YourDirectoryPath\"; // Ensure you include the backslash at the end
```

## Step 2: Create the Barcode Generator

Create an instance of the `BarcodeGenerator` class. Here, we’ll use the `Code128` barcode type and set the value to "ASPOSE":

```csharp
BarcodeGenerator barcodeGen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Code128, "ASPOSE");
```

## Step 3: Adjust the Barcode Height

This step involves modifying the barcode’s height using the `BarHeight` property. We’ll demonstrate how to create two barcode images with different heights—40 pixels and 80 pixels.

```csharp
// Adjust the height to 40 pixels
barcodeGen.Parameters.Barcode.BarHeight.Pixels = 40;
barcodeGen.Save($"{path}BarHeight40Code128.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);

// Adjust the height to 80 pixels
barcodeGen.Parameters.Barcode.BarHeight.Pixels = 80;
barcodeGen.Save($"{path}BarHeight80Code128.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to adjust the height of a one-dimensional barcode using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. With the ability to customize various barcode properties, you can create tailored barcode images to meet your specific application requirements.
