## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on converting Microsoft Project files to HTML format using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. This powerful library offers developers the ability to manipulate Microsoft Project files programmatically with ease. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, please ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with the C# programming language is assumed.
2. Aspose.Tasks Installation: Ensure you have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed in your development environment. You can easily obtain it from the [Aspose website](https://www.aspose.com).
3. Microsoft Project File: Have a Microsoft Project file ready for conversion (with a `.mpp` extension).

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

To get started, we need to import the required namespaces that will give us access to all the functionalities of Aspose.Tasks.

```csharp

```

## Step 1: Load the Microsoft Project File

Load your Microsoft Project file using the following code snippet. Replace `"YourProjectFile.mpp"` with the path to your actual project file.

```csharp
var project = new Project("YourProjectFile.mpp");
```

## Step 2: Specify HTML Save Options

Next, define the HTML save options. This allows you to customize how the project data will appear when converted to HTML.

```csharp
var options = new HtmlSaveOptions();
```

## Step 3: Save Project Data as HTML

Now, it's time to save your project data in HTML format. Specify the output path in place of `"OutputFilePath.html"`.

```csharp
project.Save("OutputFilePath.html", options);
```

## Additional Functionality: Save Specific Pages

If you're interested in saving specific pages from your project, you can do so by defining which pages to include. Hereâ€™s how you can specify a particular page number:

```csharp
options.Pages.Add(pageNumber); // Replace with the desired page number
project.Save("OutputFilePath.html", options);
```
