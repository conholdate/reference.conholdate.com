## Introduction

Efficient project file management plays a pivotal role in streamlined workflows and project success. Using Aspose.Tasks for .NET, developers can convert Microsoft Project files into PDF format with precision and flexibility. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through the step-by-step process to save Microsoft Project (.mpp) files as PDFs, complete with customizable options.

## Prerequisites for Using Aspose.Tasks for .NET

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Installation  
   Download and install the library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).

2. Development Environment  
   A working knowledge of the C# programming language and a configured .NET development environment.

3. Input Microsoft Project File  
   Have a valid `.mpp` file available for conversion.

## Import Essential Namespaces

Before coding, include the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.Tasks functionalities. 

```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

## Step 1: Load the Microsoft Project File

To begin, load the `.mpp` file into the `Project` object. Replace `"Your_Project_File_Path.mpp"` with the path to your input file.

```csharp
var project = new Project("Your_Project_File_Path.mpp");
```

## Step 2: Configure PDF Save Options

Set up options to customize the output PDF. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides flexibility to control page rendering, layout, and other aspects.

```csharp
var options = new PdfSaveOptions
{
    RenderToSinglePage = false, // Whether to render all content on a single page
    Pages = new List<int>()     // Pages to include in the PDF
};
```

## Step 3: Determine the Page Count

Use the `PageCount` property to identify how many pages the project spans. This helps decide whether to include specific pages or export all.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Total Pages: " + options.PageCount);
```

## Step 4: Select Specific Pages for Export (Optional)

Specify the exact pages to be included in the PDF by populating the `Pages` property. For example, to export pages 1 and 4:

```csharp
options.Pages.Add(1);
options.Pages.Add(4);
```

## Step 5: Save the Project File as PDF

Finally, save the `.mpp` file as a PDF by calling the `Save` method. Specify the output file path and pass the configured options.

```csharp
project.Save("Output_PDF_File_Path.pdf", options);
```
