## Introduction

Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library designed to help developers work with emails efficiently. It supports various features, including email creation, sending, receiving, and manipulation. This tutorial will focus on constructing and sending an email message from scratch.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have a C# development environment ready. You can use Visual Studio or any other IDE of your choice. 

### Install Aspose.Email via NuGet

To add the Aspose.Email library to your project, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution.
3. Search for Aspose.Email and install the package.

## Creating a New Email Message

Now that you have Aspose.Email installed, let’s create a new email message. Start by creating an instance of the `MailMessage` class, which represents an email.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Smtp;

MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
```

## Specifying Email Recipients

Next, specify the email recipients using the `To`, `Cc`, and `Bcc` properties of the `MailMessage` class.

```csharp
message.To.Add("recipient@example.com");
message.Cc.Add("cc@example.com");
message.Bcc.Add("bcc@example.com");
```

## Setting the Email Subject and Body

Set the subject and body of the email using the `Subject` and `HtmlBody` properties. You can also include plain text if needed.

```csharp
message.Subject = "Hello from Aspose.Email!";
message.HtmlBody = "<p>This is the <b>HTML</b> body of the email.</p>";
```

## Adding Attachments

To attach files to the email, use the `Attachments` property. Here’s how to add a PDF file:

```csharp
Attachment attachment = new Attachment("path/to/attachment.pdf");
message.Attachments.Add(attachment);
```

## Incorporating Hyperlinks

You can enhance the email body by adding hyperlinks using HTML `<a>` tags.

```csharp
message.HtmlBody += "<p>Click <a href='https://example.com'>here</a> to visit our website.</p>";
```

## Formatting the Email Content

Aspose.Email allows for rich formatting using HTML and CSS. Here’s an example of adding styled text:

```csharp
message.HtmlBody += "<p style='color: blue;'>This text is blue.</p>";
```

## Sending the Email

After constructing the email message, use the `SmtpClient` class to send it. Here’s how:

```csharp
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587, "your_username", "your_password");
try
{
    client.Send(message);
    Console.WriteLine("Email sent successfully.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

Congratulations! You’ve successfully learned how to construct and send an email using Aspose.Email for .NET. This powerful library simplifies the integration of email functionalities into your C# applications, making it easier to communicate programmatically.
