## Introduction

Email hyperlinks serve as gateways to websites and other resources. By default, these hyperlinks feature plain text, which can blend into the background of your message. However, by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Aspose.Email for .NET, you can customize the appearance of hyperlinks, making them stand out and providing a better user experience.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.Email for .NET installed.
- A C# development environment set up (e.g., Visual Studio).

After setting up your environment, create a new project, and include the necessary Aspose.Email references.

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace CustomHyperlinkRendering
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Set your data directory path
            string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";  // Replace with your actual data directory
            var fileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "LinksSample.eml");
            MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(fileName);

            // Render and display hyperlinks
            Console.WriteLine("Hyperlinks with Href:");
            Console.WriteLine(RenderHyperlinkWithHref(msg.GetHtmlBodyText()));
            
            Console.WriteLine("\nHyperlinks without Href:");
            Console.WriteLine(RenderHyperlinkWithoutHref(msg.GetHtmlBodyText()));
        }

        // Custom hyperlink rendering methods go here
    }
}
```

## Rendering Hyperlinks with Href

The first method we'll implement is `RenderHyperlinkWithHref`, which extracts hyperlinks along with their `href` attributes.

```csharp
private static string RenderHyperlinkWithHref(string source)
{
    int start = source.IndexOf("href=\"") + "href=\"".Length;
    int end = source.IndexOf("\"", start);
    
    if (start < 0 || end < 0) return string.Empty; // return empty if href not found

    string href = source.Substring(start, end - start);
    
    start = source.IndexOf(">", end) + 1;
    end = source.IndexOf("<", start);
    
    if (start < 0 || end < 0) return string.Empty; // return empty if link text not found
    
    string text = source.Substring(start, end - start);
    
    return string.Format("{0}<{1}>", text, href);
}
```

This method performs the following steps:
1. Locates the `href` attribute to extract the URL.
2. Finds the link text between the tags.
3. Formats the output to display as "Link Text<URL>".

## Rendering Hyperlinks without Href

Next, we will create the `RenderHyperlinkWithoutHref` method to fetch hyperlink text without the `href` attribute.

```csharp
private static string RenderHyperlinkWithoutHref(string source)
{
    int start = source.IndexOf(">") + 1;
    int end = source.IndexOf("<", start);
    
    if (start < 0 || end < 0) return string.Empty; // return empty if link text not found
    
    string text = source.Substring(start, end - start);
    
    return text;
}
```

This method retrieves text enclosed by HTML anchor tags but omits the `href`, resulting in a simple rendering of the link text.
