## Introduction

In the world of web communication, MHT (MHTML) files are a handy way to store and share web content, complete with images, links, and styles. But what happens when you need to spruce up those MHT files by changing fonts? Thanks to Aspose.Email for .NET, this task becomes a breeze. In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process of changing fonts during MHT conversion, step-by-step. Whether you're developing an application that handles email formatting or just want to customize documents for your business, this guide will equip you with the knowledge you need.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, there are a few essentials you should have prepared:

1. Visual Studio: You’ll need an integrated development environment (IDE) to work on your C# project.
2. Aspose.Email for .NET Library: Make sure you have the library installed. You can download it from the [link](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).
3. .NET Framework: Your project should be compatible with .NET Framework; typically, .NET Core or later versions work well.

Got those lined up? Awesome! Let’s get started.

## Importing Packages

First off, ensure that your project is set up to use the necessary namespaces. You’ll want to include the following at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Tools;
```

These packages will give you access to the functionality needed to work with MHT files and modify their contents.

Now, let’s break down the steps involved in changing fonts during MHT conversion.

## Step 1: Load the MHT File

The first thing you’ll need to do is load your MHT file into a `MailMessage` object. This is where you can access and manipulate its content.

```csharp
MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load("input.mht", new MhtmlLoadOptions());
```

Explanation: Here, `"input.mht"` is the path to your MHT file. The `MhtmlLoadOptions()` allows you to configure how the file is loaded, for example, handling attachments or linked resources differently.

## Step 2: Iterate Through Alternate Views

MHT files often have multiple alternate views, especially if they include HTML content. You need to loop through these views to find the one you want to modify.

```csharp
foreach (var alternateView in message.AlternateViews)
{
    if (alternateView.ContentType.MediaType == "text/html")
    {
        var htmlView = (AlternateView)alternateView;
        var linkedResources = htmlView.LinkedResources;
```

Explanation: You’re checking each `AlternateView` to see if it’s of type HTML. If it is, you can access `LinkedResources`, where any fonts linked in the HTML are typically stored.

## Step 3: Identify and Customize Fonts

Now that you have access to the linked resources, you can identify which resources are fonts and customize them as needed.

```csharp
foreach (var linkedResource in linkedResources)
{
    if (linkedResource.ContentType.MediaType == "application/x-font-ttf")
    {
        linkedResource.ContentType.Name = "Arial";  // Change to desired font
        linkedResource.TransferEncoding = TransferEncoding.Base64;  // Make sure it’s properly encoded
    }
}
```

Explanation: This loop checks if the content type of the linked resource is a TrueType font. If it matches, you can change the font's name to what you want (like "Arial" in this example). The `TransferEncoding` should also be set to ensure that the font data is encoded correctly when the document is saved.

## Step 4: Save the Updated MHT File

After customizing the fonts, it’s time to save your modified MHT file. You’ll want to ensure you use the correct saving options to maintain the integrity of your file.

```csharp
message.Save("output.mht", SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml);
```

Explanation: In this line of code, `"output.mht"` is the name of the file where you want to save the updated content. Using `SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml` ensures that the new file maintains the MHT format.

## Conclusion

Changing fonts in MHT files can significantly enhance the look and feel of your documents. By leveraging Aspose.Email for .NET, you can easily load MHT files, modify their content, and save the changes using just a few lines of code. Whether you’re working on a personal project or a larger application, mastering these skills can improve how you present information.
