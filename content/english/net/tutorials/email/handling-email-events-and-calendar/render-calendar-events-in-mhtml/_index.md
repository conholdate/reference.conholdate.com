## Introduction

Aspose.Email for .NET is a powerful library for handling email-related tasks in .NET applications. One fascinating use case is rendering calendar events programmatically using C#. Whether you're building a calendar integration feature or creating custom email viewers, this tutorial will guide you through rendering calendar events into MHTML format with precision and customization.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, let’s ensure we have everything ready to follow this tutorial:

1. Aspose.Email for .NET Library: Download the latest version of the library from the [Aspose.Email for .NET download page](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio (or your preferred C# IDE) installed on your system.
3. License: Obtain a valid license for Aspose.Email. For evaluation purposes, you can use a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
4. Sample MSG File: A calendar event MSG file. You can use any `.msg` file with calendar events, such as "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.msg."

## Import Packages

To get started, include the necessary namespaces in your project. 

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mht;
```

Now, let’s jump into the step-by-step guide!

## Step 1: Load the Calendar Event MSG File

First, we load the MSG file that contains the calendar event. This step is essential as it acts as the input for rendering the event into MHTML format.


```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
string fileName = "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.msg";

// Load the MSG file
MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + fileName);
```

- `dataDir`: Specifies the directory where your MSG file is stored.
- `fileName`: Name of the calendar event file.
- `MailMessage.Load`: Reads the file and loads it into a `MailMessage` object.

## Step 2: Configure MHTML Save Options

Next, we configure the options for rendering the calendar event into MHTML format. This includes enabling specific formats, headers, and other properties for customization.

```csharp
MhtSaveOptions options = new MhtSaveOptions
{
    MhtFormatOptions = MhtFormatOptions.WriteHeader | MhtFormatOptions.RenderCalendarEvent
};
```

- `MhtSaveOptions`: Represents the settings for saving MHTML files.
- `MhtFormatOptions`: Configures options such as including headers and rendering calendar events.

## Step 3: Customize the Display Templates

Here, we define how specific properties, like the event's start time, should appear in the output. This step allows for a highly customizable and readable output.


```csharp
if (options.FormatTemplates.ContainsKey(MhtTemplateName.Start))
    options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.Start] = @"<span class='headerLineTitle'>Start:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>";
else
    options.FormatTemplates.Add(MhtTemplateName.Start, @"<span class='headerLineTitle'>Start:</span><span class='headerLineText'>{0}</span><br/>");
```

- `MhtTemplateName.Start`: Refers to the "Start" property of the calendar event.
- `options.FormatTemplates`: Customizes the display template for specific properties.

## Step 4: Save the Calendar Event as MHTML

Finally, save the calendar event to an MHTML file with the configured options.


```csharp
msg.Save(dataDir + "Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.mhtml", options);
```

- `msg.Save`: Saves the message in the specified format and location.
- `Meeting with Recurring Occurrences.mhtml`: Output file name.

## Conclusion

Rendering calendar events using Aspose.Email for .NET is both efficient and highly customizable. By following the steps above, you can seamlessly convert calendar events into an MHTML file, complete with tailored formatting.
