## Introduction

Managing email documents efficiently often involves tracking the progress of their conversion. Aspose.Email for .NET provides robust tools to accomplish this, allowing developers to handle email operations seamlessly. This tutorial dives into how you can track the email document conversion progress in C#, breaking down the process step-by-step for ease of understanding.  

## Prerequisites  

Before we dive into the tutorial, let’s ensure you have everything set up:  

1. Aspose.Email for .NET: Download and install the [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/) library.  
2. Development Environment: Install Visual Studio or any other .NET-compatible IDE.  
3. .NET Framework: Ensure .NET Framework 4.5 or later is installed.  
4. Temporary License: Consider obtaining a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to explore the full features of Aspose.Email.  
5. Sample Email File: Prepare an `.eml` file (e.g., `test.eml`) to use as a sample.  

## Import Packages  

To use Aspose.Email in your project, you’ll need to import the required namespaces. Add the following using statements at the top of your file:  

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.SaveOptions;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project  

Start by creating a new C# console application in Visual Studio. This will serve as the foundation for implementing the email document conversion tracking.  
  
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project.  
2. Install the Aspose.Email NuGet package:  
```sh
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```  
3. Add the `.eml` file to your project directory.  

## Step 2: Load the Email File  

Now, load the email file into a `MailMessage` object. This is the first step in working with email data.  
 
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var fileName = dataDir + "test.eml";
MailMessage msg = MailMessage.Load(fileName);
```
 
- `dataDir`: Specifies the directory where your email file is located.  
- `MailMessage.Load`: Reads the `.eml` file and prepares it for further operations.  

## Step 3: Initialize a Memory Stream  

Next, create a `MemoryStream` object to store the converted email data temporarily.  
 
```csharp
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
```

A `MemoryStream` is used here to manage the output of the conversion process without saving the data directly to disk.  

## Step 4: Define Conversion Options  

Set up the `EmlSaveOptions` with a custom progress handler to track the conversion progress.  
 
```csharp
EmlSaveOptions opt = new EmlSaveOptions(MailMessageSaveType.EmlFormat);
opt.CustomProgressHandler = new ConversionProgressEventHandler(ShowEmlConversionProgress);
```
  
- `MailMessageSaveType.EmlFormat`: Specifies the output format.  
- `CustomProgressHandler`: Assigns a custom handler function to monitor progress.  

## Step 5: Save the Email to the Memory Stream  

Save the `MailMessage` object using the specified options, enabling the progress tracking functionality.  
 
```csharp
msg.Save(ms, opt);
```
 
This step initiates the email conversion process and sends updates to the progress handler.  

## Step 6: Implement the Progress Handler  

Define the `ShowEmlConversionProgress` method to handle progress updates and display them in the console.  
 
```csharp
private static void ShowEmlConversionProgress(ProgressEventHandlerInfo info)
{
    int total;
    int saved;

    switch (info.EventType)
    {
        case ProgressEventType.MimeStructureCreated:
            total = info.TotalMimePartCount;
            saved = info.SavedMimePartCount;
            Console.WriteLine($"MimeStructureCreated - TotalMimePartCount: {total}");
            Console.WriteLine($"MimeStructureCreated - SavedMimePartCount: {saved}");
            break;

        case ProgressEventType.MimePartSaved:
            total = info.TotalMimePartCount;
            saved = info.SavedMimePartCount;
            Console.WriteLine($"MimePartSaved - TotalMimePartCount: {total}");
            Console.WriteLine($"MimePartSaved - SavedMimePartCount: {saved}");
            break;

        case ProgressEventType.SavedToStream:
            total = info.TotalMimePartCount;
            saved = info.SavedMimePartCount;
            Console.WriteLine($"SavedToStream - TotalMimePartCount: {total}");
            Console.WriteLine($"SavedToStream - SavedMimePartCount: {saved}");
            break;
    }
}
```
 
- `ProgressEventHandlerInfo`: Provides details about the conversion process.  
- Switch Cases: Handle different stages of the conversion: `MimeStructureCreated`, `MimePartSaved`, and `SavedToStream`.  

### What to Expect?  
As the conversion progresses, you’ll see detailed updates printed to the console, such as:  
```plaintext
MimeStructureCreated - TotalMimePartCount: 10  
MimeStructureCreated - SavedMimePartCount: 3  
MimePartSaved - TotalMimePartCount: 10  
MimePartSaved - SavedMimePartCount: 5  
```

## Conclusion  

Tracking the conversion progress of email documents in C# has never been easier, thanks to Aspose.Email for .NET. By following this tutorial, you’ve learned how to load an email file, set up a progress handler, and save the email data while monitoring the entire process. This functionality ensures you stay informed and in control during email document operations.  

## FAQ's  

### Can I use this code for formats other than `.eml`?  
Yes, modify the `MailMessageSaveType` to suit other formats like MSG or MHTML.  

### How do I handle large email files?  
Consider using a `FileStream` instead of a `MemoryStream` for better performance with large files.
