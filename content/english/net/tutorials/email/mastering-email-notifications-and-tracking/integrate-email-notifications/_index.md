## Introduction

Email notifications play a critical role in keeping users updated about important events or changes in your application. Aspose.Email for .NET is a robust library that simplifies email handling in C#. In this tutorial, we'll focus on how to set up Aspose.Email, create an email message, configure delivery notifications, and send the email.

## Setting Up Aspose.Email

Before we start coding, you need to set up the Aspose.Email library in your project. Follow these steps:

1. Install Aspose.Email: Use the NuGet Package Manager to install Aspose.Email for .NET. You can do this by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:
```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

2. Import the Namespace: In your C# file, include the necessary namespace:
```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Smtp;
```

## Creating an Email Message

With Aspose.Email set up, we can create an email message. Below is an example of how to create a basic email message with essential components such as sender, recipient, subject, and body.

```csharp
// Create the email message
MailMessage msg = new MailMessage
{
    From = "sender@example.com",
    To = { "receiver@example.com" },
    Subject = "Subject of the Email",
    Body = "This is the body of the email."
};
```

## Configuring Delivery Notifications

To receive notifications regarding the delivery status of your email, configure the delivery notification options. You can specify whether you want to be notified on successful delivery, failure, or both.

```csharp
// Set delivery notification options
msg.DeliveryNotificationOptions = DeliveryNotificationOptions.OnSuccess | DeliveryNotificationOptions.OnFailure;
```

## Adding MIME Headers

MIME headers can provide additional context about your email message. You can include custom MIME headers as necessary. Here's how to add a disposition notification header:

```csharp
// Add MIME headers for delivery notifications
msg.Headers.Add("Disposition-Notification-To", "sender@example.com");
```

## Sending the Email

After configuring your email message, you can send it using the SMTP client provided by Aspose.Email. Here’s how to do it:

```csharp
// Configure the SMTP client
using (SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", 587, "username", "password"))
{
    // Send the message
    client.Send(msg);
}
```

Make sure to replace `"smtp.example.com"`, `587`, `"username"`, and `"password"` with your actual SMTP server details.
