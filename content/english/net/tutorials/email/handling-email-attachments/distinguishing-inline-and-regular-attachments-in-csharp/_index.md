## Introduction

Email attachments are essential in conveying information beyond the text of an email. Among the various types of attachments, inline attachments (embedded within the email body) and regular attachments (separate files) are the most common. This guide will explore how to distinguish between these two types of attachments using the Aspose.Email for .NET library, with step-by-step instructions and practical code snippets.

## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you start coding, ensure that your development environment is ready. You will need Visual Studio installed on your system. 

## 2. Creating a New Project

- Open Visual Studio.
- Select Create a new project.
- Choose a project template that suits your needs (such as Console Application for quick testing).

## 3. Installing the Aspose.Email for .NET Library

The Aspose.Email library facilitates email processing, including accessing attachments. You can easily install it via NuGet Package Manager. Open the Package Manager Console and run the following command:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Email
```

## 4. Loading an Email Message

To work with attachments, you must first load an email message. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Exchange;

// Load the email message from a file or any other source
MailMessage emailMessage = MailMessage.Load("path/to/your/email/file.eml");
```

## 5. Retrieving Attachments

Once you have the email loaded, you can access the collection of attachments. Use the following code snippet to retrieve all attachments:

```csharp
AttachmentCollection attachments = emailMessage.Attachments;
```

## 6. Distinguishing Between Inline and Regular Attachments

To tell inline attachments apart from regular attachments, inspect the `ContentDisposition` property of each attachment. Inline attachments have a disposition type of "inline."

### Inline Attachment Example:

Here’s how to identify and handle inline attachments:

```csharp
foreach (Attachment attachment in attachments)
{
    if (attachment.ContentDisposition.DispositionType.Equals("inline"))
    {
        // Handle inline attachment
        string contentId = attachment.ContentId;
        string contentType = attachment.ContentType.Name;
        Console.WriteLine($"Inline Attachment: {contentId}, Type: {contentType}");
    }
}
```

### Regular Attachment Example:

For regular attachments, you can handle them as follows:

```csharp
foreach (Attachment attachment in attachments)
{
    if (!attachment.ContentDisposition.DispositionType.Equals("inline"))
    {
        // Handle regular attachment
        string filePath = Path.Combine("path/to/save/directory", attachment.Name);
        attachment.Save(filePath);
        Console.WriteLine($"Regular Attachment saved: {filePath}");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This guide provided insights into differentiating between inline and regular attachments using the Aspose.Email for .NET library. By following the step-by-step instructions and utilizing the code snippets, you can effectively manage email attachments in your applications.
