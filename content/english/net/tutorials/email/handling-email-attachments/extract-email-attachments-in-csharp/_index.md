## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself manually downloading email attachments, one by one? It’s not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. Luckily, Aspose.Email for .NET offers a powerful and efficient way to automate this task. Whether you're dealing with PDFs, images, or any other file type, you can extract attachments effortlessly using C#.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through a complete tutorial, starting from the prerequisites to a fully working example. Ready to save hours of manual work? Let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before you start coding, ensure you have the following:

- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Email for .NET library. You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/) or install it via NuGet.
- A valid email account (IMAP/POP3 supported).
- A basic understanding of C# programming.

If you’re new to Aspose.Email, consider requesting a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) or a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to unlock the full features.

## Import Packages

Before diving into the code, make sure you’ve imported the necessary namespaces. Add the following at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Imap;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Pop3;
```

Let’s break the process into digestible steps. Follow each step carefully to ensure smooth execution.


## Step 1: Set Up Your IMAP Client

The first step is to connect to your email server using the IMAP protocol. IMAP allows us to access and retrieve email messages from the server.

```csharp
ImapClient client = new ImapClient("imap.example.com", "username", "password");
client.SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox);
```

- Replace `imap.example.com` with your email provider’s IMAP server address (e.g., `imap.gmail.com` for Gmail).
- Use your actual email `username` and `password`.
- `SelectFolder(ImapFolderInfo.InBox)` specifies that we want to work with the inbox.


## Step 2: Retrieve Emails from the Inbox

Once connected, you need to fetch email messages from the inbox. Aspose.Email provides a simple method to list all messages.

```csharp
ImapMessageInfoCollection messages = client.ListMessages();
```

- `ListMessages()` retrieves metadata for all emails in the inbox.
- The `ImapMessageInfoCollection` object contains details like sender, subject, and unique IDs.


## Step 3: Fetch Each Email Message

To access the content and attachments, you need to fetch each email using its unique ID.


```csharp
foreach (ImapMessageInfo messageInfo in messages)
{
    MailMessage message = client.FetchMessage(messageInfo.UniqueId);
}
```

- The `foreach` loop iterates through all messages.
- `FetchMessage()` retrieves the actual email content for a given message ID.


## Step 4: Loop Through Attachments

Now that you have the email content, it’s time to extract attachments. Each `MailMessage` object contains a collection of attachments.

```csharp
foreach (Attachment attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Attachment Name: {attachment.Name}");
}
```

- The `Attachments` property lists all attachments in the email.
- Use `attachment.Name` to get the file name.


## Step 5: Save Attachments to Disk

Finally, save the attachments to your local machine. You can filter files by type, size, or other criteria.

```csharp
foreach (Attachment attachment in message.Attachments)
{
    string filePath = Path.Combine("C:\\Attachments", attachment.Name);
    using (var stream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create))
    {
        attachment.Save(stream);
    }
}
```

- Replace `"C:\\Attachments"` with your desired folder path.
- The `attachment.Save()` method writes the file to disk.


## Step 6: Process Attachments by Type

If you need to handle attachments differently based on their type (e.g., PDF vs. JPEG), Aspose.Email makes it easy.

```csharp
if (attachment.ContentType.MediaType == "application/pdf")
{
    Console.WriteLine("Processing PDF...");
}
else if (attachment.ContentType.MediaType == "image/jpeg")
{
    Console.WriteLine("Processing JPEG...");
}
```

- `ContentType.MediaType` identifies the file type (e.g., `application/pdf` for PDFs, `image/jpeg` for images).
- Add custom logic for different file types as needed.


## Conclusion

And there you have it! Extracting attachments from emails is no longer a tedious task. With Aspose.Email for .NET, you can automate this process in just a few lines of code. From setting up the IMAP client to saving attachments locally, this guide has covered everything you need to get started.
