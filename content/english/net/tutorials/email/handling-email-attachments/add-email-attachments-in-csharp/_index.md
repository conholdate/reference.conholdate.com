## Creating a New Email Message

To create and prepare an email message with attachments, follow these steps:

1. Import Necessary Namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Attachment;
```

2. Create a New MailMessage Instance:

```csharp

    Body = "Please find the attached files."
};
```

## Adding Attachments to the Email

To include attachments in your email:

1. Instantiate the Attachment Class:

```csharp
// Specify the path to your attachment file
Attachment attachment = new Attachment("C:\\path_to_attachment.pdf");
message.Attachments.Add(attachment);
```

2. Adding Multiple Attachments:

You can easily add multiple attachments by repeating the above step for each file:

```csharp
Attachment anotherAttachment = new Attachment("C:\\path_to_second_attachment.jpg");
message.Attachments.Add(anotherAttachment);
```

## Saving and Sending the Email

Once your email message is ready with attachments, use the `SmtpClient` class to send it:

```csharp
// Initialize the SmtpClient with your SMTP server details
using (SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com", "username", "password"))
{
    client.Send(message); // Sends the email message
}
```
