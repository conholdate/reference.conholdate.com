## Introduction

When you're dealing with PDF files, understanding metadata can be a game-changer. But what exactly is PDF metadata? Simply put, it’s data that provides information about other data within your PDF documents. Think of it as a book’s cover—while it doesn't contain the content, it tells you a lot about what's inside! With GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET, you can easily read and manage this metadata, making your PDF management tasks much more efficient.

## Reading Built-In Properties from PDFs

The first step in harnessing the power of GroupDocs.Metadata is learning how to read built-in properties from your PDF files. These properties include essential information like the document title, author, creation date, and more. It’s like peeking into the metadata closet of your PDF!

In the [Reading Built-In Properties from PDFs in .NET](./reading-built-in-properties-from-pdf/) tutorial, you'll find a user-friendly guide that walks you through each step necessary to access these properties. With clear code examples and explanations, you’ll be able to pull vital information from your PDFs almost effortlessly. Just imagine how much easier it will be to catalog your documents when you have this information at your fingertips!

## Reading Custom Properties from PDFs

But what if you need to access metadata that isn't part of those standard fields? That's where custom properties come into play. These are user-defined fields that can hold additional information specific to your needs—like the project name or the version of the document. It’s like adding personal notes in a library book; it gives you extra context that standard metadata might not cover.

Our tutorial on [Reading Custom Properties from PDFs in .NET](./reading-custom-properties-from-pdf/) dives deep into how to efficiently manage these custom fields. You'll learn about how to define, read, and edit these properties using GroupDocs.Metadata. Just think about the possibilities—whether it’s for adding notes or tracking document versions, this feature can significantly enhance your workflow!
