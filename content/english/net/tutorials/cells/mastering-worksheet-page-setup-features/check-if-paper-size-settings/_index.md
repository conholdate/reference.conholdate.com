## Introduction

When handling spreadsheets, ensuring optimal presentation for printing is crucial. A key aspect of this is the paper size setting. In this guide, we'll explore how to determine if a worksheet's paper size is set to automatic using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This powerful library allows for seamless Excel manipulation, making your tasks more efficient and manageable.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into coding, let's ensure you have the necessary setup:

1. C# Development Environment: You need a suitable IDE like Visual Studio. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the Microsoft website.
   
2. Aspose.Cells Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library. You can easily download it from [Aspose](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).

3. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming principles will help you understand the provided examples effectively.

4. Sample Excel Files: Obtain the following sample files to work with:
   - `samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-False.xlsx`
   - `samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-True.xlsx`

With these prerequisites in place, youâ€™re ready to begin!

## Setting Up Your Project

### Create a New Project
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Create a new C# Console Application project. You might name it `CheckPaperSize`.

### Add Aspose.Cells Reference
1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for Aspose.Cells and install it.

Now, add the following namespace to your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

## Step 1: Define Source and Output Directories
Start by specifying the location of your sample Excel files and where you want to save any outputs:
```csharp
// Define the source directory for the Excel files
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the Workbooks
Next, load the two workbooks prepared earlier:
```csharp
// Load the first workbook with automatic paper size set to false
Workbook wb1 = new Workbook(sourceDir + "samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-False.xlsx");
// Load the second workbook with automatic paper size set to true
Workbook wb2 = new Workbook(sourceDir + "samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-True.xlsx");
```
This allows for effective comparison of the settings.

## Step 3: Access the Worksheets
Now, access the first worksheet from both workbooks:
```csharp
// Access the first worksheet from both workbooks
Worksheet ws1 = wb1.Worksheets[0];
Worksheet ws2 = wb2.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 4: Check the IsAutomaticPaperSize Property
To verify the paper size settings, check the `IsAutomaticPaperSize` property:
```csharp
// Output the PageSetup.IsAutomaticPaperSize property of both worksheets
Console.WriteLine("First Workbook - IsAutomaticPaperSize: " + ws1.PageSetup.IsAutomaticPaperSize);
Console.WriteLine("Second Workbook - IsAutomaticPaperSize: " + ws2.PageSetup.IsAutomaticPaperSize);
```
This prints whether the automatic paper size feature is enabled for each worksheet.

## Step 5: Confirmation of Results
Finally, print a success message to confirm the program executed successfully:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Paper size check executed successfully.");
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've successfully explored how to check if the paper size settings of worksheets in Excel files are set to automatic using Aspose.Cells for .NET. By following these steps, you now possess the foundational skills to programmatically manipulate Excel files and verify specific configurations like paper size.
