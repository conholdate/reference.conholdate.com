## Introduction

Headers and footers are essential elements in Excel spreadsheets, providing critical contextual information such as file names, dates, and page numbers. Whether you’re automating reports or generating dynamic files, Aspose.Cells for .NET simplifies the process of customizing headers and footers programmatically. This guide offers a step-by-step approach to enhance your Excel files with polished and professional headers and footers.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download and install it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
2. IDE Setup: Use Visual Studio or your preferred IDE with the .NET framework.
3. License: Start with a free trial, but consider obtaining a full or temporary license for complete functionality. You can [get a temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

## Importing Required Packages

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces in your project:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

This will give you access to the classes and methods needed for working with headers, footers, and other Excel functionalities in Aspose.Cells.

## Step 1: Create a Workbook and Access Page Setup

Start by creating a new workbook and accessing the worksheet’s page setup. This is where you’ll modify the header and footer settings.

```csharp
// Define the path to save your document
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Instantiate a Workbook object
Workbook excel = new Workbook();
```

Here, a `Workbook` object represents your Excel file. The `PageSetup` property of the worksheet will allow you to customize headers and footers.

## Step 2: Access the Worksheet and PageSetup Properties

Each worksheet in Aspose.Cells has a `PageSetup` property that governs layout features, including headers and footers. Obtain the `PageSetup` object for your worksheet:

```csharp
// Obtain the reference to the PageSetup of the first worksheet
PageSetup pageSetup = excel.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```

Now, `pageSetup` contains the settings required to customize headers and footers.

## Step 3: Set the Left Section of the Header

Headers consist of three sections: left, center, and right. Let’s start by setting the left section to display the worksheet name.

```csharp
// Set worksheet name in the left section of the header
pageSetup.SetHeader(0, "&A");
```

Using `&A` dynamically displays the worksheet name, which is especially useful for multi-sheet workbooks.

## Step 4: Add Date and Time to the Center of the Header

Next, add the current date and time to the center section of the header, applying a custom font for styling.

```csharp
// Set date and time in the center section of the header with bold font
pageSetup.SetHeader(1, "&\"Times New Roman,Bold\"&D-&T");
```

In this line:
- `&D` inserts the current date.
- `&T` inserts the current time.
- `"Times New Roman,Bold"` applies a bold Times New Roman font.

## Step 5: Display File Name in the Right Section of the Header

To complete the header, display the file name on the right side with a specified font size.

```csharp
// Display file name in the right section of the header with custom font size
pageSetup.SetHeader(2, "&\"Times New Roman,Bold\"&12&F");
```

Here, `&F` represents the file name, and `&12` sets the font size to 12.

## Step 6: Add Custom Text to the Left Footer Section

Now, let’s set the left footer section with custom text and a specific font style.

```csharp
// Add custom text with font style to the left section of the footer
pageSetup.SetFooter(0, "Hello World! &\"Courier New\"&14 123");
```

In this example, the text `123` is styled with "Courier New" font at size 14, while the rest remains in the default footer font.

## Step 7: Insert Page Number in the Center of the Footer

Including page numbers in the footer helps readers track multi-page documents.

```csharp
// Insert page number in the center section of the footer
pageSetup.SetFooter(1, "&P");
```

The `&P` code adds the current page number to the footer’s center section.

## Step 8: Show Total Page Count in the Right Footer Section

Complete the footer by displaying the total page count in the right section.

```csharp
// Display total page count in the right section of the footer
pageSetup.SetFooter(2, "&N");
```

The `&N` code provides the total page count, informing readers of the document's length.

## Step 9: Save the Workbook

Finally, save the workbook to generate an Excel file with the customized headers and footers.

```csharp
// Save the Workbook
excel.Save(dataDir + "SetHeadersAndFooters_out.xls");
```

This line saves the file with your customizations in place.

## Conclusion

Customizing headers and footers in Excel worksheets enhances the professionalism of your documents. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can easily control these elements, from displaying worksheet names to inserting custom text, dates, times, and dynamic page numbers. Now that you’ve learned the steps, you can elevate your Excel automation projects.
