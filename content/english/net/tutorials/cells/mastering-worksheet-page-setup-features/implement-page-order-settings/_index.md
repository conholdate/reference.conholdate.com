## Introduction

When working with large Excel spreadsheets, controlling the print layout is crucial for clarity and organization. Aspose.Cells for .NET offers robust features that allow you to customize the print settings of your worksheets effortlessly. In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps to set the page order to print across rows first and then down columns.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) and install it in your project.
2. Development Environment: Use any .NET-compatible IDE, such as Visual Studio.
3. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# will help you understand the code snippets.

You can also try out [Aspose.Cells for .NET with a free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) or get a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for full feature access.

## Import Necessary Packages

Start by importing the required namespaces to access Aspose.Cells functionalities:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

## Step 1: Create a Workbook

First, create a new workbook instance, which represents your Excel file.

```csharp
// Create a new Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This line initializes a blank Excel workbook, ready for customization.

## Step 2: Access the PageSetup of the Worksheet

To adjust the print settings, access the `PageSetup` object of the worksheet.

```csharp
// Access the PageSetup of the first worksheet
PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```

Here, we retrieve the `PageSetup` for the first worksheet, where we’ll configure the print layout.

## Step 3: Set the Page Order to OverThenDown

Now, let’s set the page order. By default, Excel prints down each column first; we’ll change it to print across rows first.

```csharp
// Set the print order to OverThenDown
pageSetup.Order = PrintOrderType.OverThenDown;
```

This setting ensures that when printing, the data flows horizontally before moving to the next row, which is particularly useful for wide datasets.

## Step 4: Save the Workbook

Finally, save your workbook to apply the changes.

```csharp
// Define the path to save the workbook
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory/";
// Save the workbook
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPageOrder_out.xls");
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with your desired file path. You can also save it in other formats, such as `.xlsx`, by changing the file extension.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully set the page order in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This simple adjustment can significantly enhance the presentation of large datasets when printed. Aspose.Cells provides many other customizable print settings, making it an invaluable tool for report preparation and document organization.
