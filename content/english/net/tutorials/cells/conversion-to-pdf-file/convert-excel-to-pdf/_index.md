With these prerequisites, you’re ready to start transforming your Excel files into PDFs using Aspose.Cells!

## Setting Up the Project

Let’s begin by configuring the development environment to enable the functionalities of Aspose.Cells.

### Creating a New .NET Project
1. Open Visual Studio and select “Create a new project.”
2. Choose the Console App (.NET Framework) template.
3. Name your project, for example, "ExcelToPDFConverter," and set the framework to .NET 4.0 or higher.

### Adding Aspose.Cells to the Project
1. Right-click your project in Solution Explorer and select Manage NuGet Packages.
2. In the NuGet Package Manager, search for "Aspose.Cells" and install it to add it to your project.

### Importing Required Namespaces
In your `Program.cs`, add the following namespaces to access the Aspose.Cells functionalities:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

With this setup, you’re now ready to dive into the coding process.

Follow these steps to convert an Excel file to a PDF document, preserving its original formatting.

## Step 1: Define the File Path
Set up the path to the directory where your Excel files are stored and where you want to save the PDF output.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"C:\ExcelFiles\"` with the directory path on your system.

## Step 2: Load the Excel File into a Workbook Object
Create a new Workbook object by loading your Excel file. This Workbook object will hold the data and format of your spreadsheet.

```csharp
// Instantiate the Workbook object to open the Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "sample.xlsx");
```

Make sure `sample.xlsx` exists in your `dataDir`.

## Step 3: Convert and Save the Excel as PDF
Save the Workbook as a PDF, specifying the file path and save options.

```csharp
// Save the workbook to PDF format
workbook.Save(dataDir + "Output.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

The above code converts the `sample.xlsx` file to `Output.pdf` in the specified directory, applying the options you set earlier.

## Step 4: Confirm Completion
After the conversion, print a message to indicate that the PDF has been created successfully.

```csharp
// Notify the user of completion
Console.WriteLine("Excel to PDF conversion completed successfully.");
```

## Conclusion

With Aspose.Cells for .NET, converting Excel spreadsheets into PDF documents becomes an efficient process, enabling developers to maintain the quality and integrity of their data. Aspose.Cells is a robust library offering extensive customization options, allowing developers to create tailored PDF documents that meet exact business needs.
