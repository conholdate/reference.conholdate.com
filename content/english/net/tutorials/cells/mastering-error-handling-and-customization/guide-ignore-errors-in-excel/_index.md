## Introduction

Converting Excel files to PDF can sometimes be a frustrating experience, especially when errors pop up unexpectedly. If you're dealing with critical data that needs to be shared or archived, interruptions during conversion can be a nightmare. Fortunately, Aspose.Cells for .NET offers a solution that allows you to ignore these pesky errors and convert your Excel sheets into polished PDFs seamlessly. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process step-by-step!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following in place:

1. .NET Environment: Make sure you have .NET installed on your machine. Aspose.Cells works with both .NET Framework and .NET Core.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: Integrate the Aspose.Cells library into your project. If you haven't done this yet, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you follow along smoothly.
4. Sample Excel File: Prepare a sample Excel workbook that you expect might throw errors during conversion.

With everything set, let’s get started with the coding!

## Step 1: Import Necessary Packages

To access Aspose.Cells functionalities, you’ll need to import the required namespaces. Add the following lines at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

This will allow you to utilize the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Cells in your project.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Directories

Define where your source Excel file is located and where you want to save the output PDF. Create variables for these paths:

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Ensure these paths are correct to avoid file not found errors.

## Step 3: Load the Sample Workbook

Next, load your Excel workbook by creating an instance of the `Workbook` class and passing the path of your Excel file:

```csharp
// Load the Sample Workbook that may throw errors during conversion
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleErrorExcel2Pdf.xlsx");
```

Replace `"sampleErrorExcel2Pdf.xlsx"` with the actual filename of your Excel document.

## Step 4: Specify PDF Save Options

Here’s the key step: configure the `PdfSaveOptions` to ignore errors during conversion. Set the `IgnoreError` property to `true`:

```csharp
// Specify PDF Save Options - Ignore Errors
PdfSaveOptions opts = new PdfSaveOptions();
opts.IgnoreError = true;
```

With this setting, your conversion process will overlook any errors that occur.

## Step 5: Save the Workbook as PDF

Now, it’s time to convert and save the document as a PDF. Use the `Save` method of the `Workbook` class:

```csharp
// Save the Workbook as PDF with specified options
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputErrorExcel2Pdf.pdf", opts);
```

Feel free to change `"outputErrorExcel2Pdf.pdf"` to your preferred PDF filename.

## Step 6: Confirm Successful Execution

After saving the PDF, it’s a good practice to inform yourself (or users) that the process was successful. You can do this with a simple console message:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Conversion executed successfully. Check your output directory for the PDF.");
```

Once you run this code, check your output directory for the newly created PDF!

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully converted an Excel file to a PDF while ignoring any errors encountered during the process. Aspose.Cells for .NET not only simplifies this task but also allows you to work efficiently with your data without getting bogged down by common Excel issues.
