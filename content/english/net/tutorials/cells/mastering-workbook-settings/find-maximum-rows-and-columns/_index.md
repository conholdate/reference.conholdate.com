## Introduction

Managing large datasets in Excel can be challenging, especially regarding the limits of various file formats. This tutorial will guide you through using the Aspose.Cells for .NET library to determine the maximum number of rows and columns supported by XLS (Excel 97-2003) and XLSX (Excel 2007 and later) formats. By the end, you will be equipped to handle Excel-related tasks efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed on your system.
2. [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) library downloaded and referenced in your project (you can also install it via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Cells/)).

## Importing Required Packages

Add the following using statements at the top of your C# file to import necessary packages from the Aspose.Cells library:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Maximum Rows and Columns for XLS Format

Let’s begin by finding the maximum rows and columns supported by the XLS format.

```csharp
// Print message about XLS format.
Console.WriteLine("Maximum Rows and Columns supported by XLS format:");

// Create a workbook in XLS format.
Workbook wb = new Workbook(FileFormatType.Excel97To2003);

// Retrieve maximum rows and columns.
int maxRows = wb.Settings.MaxRow + 1;
int maxCols = wb.Settings.MaxColumn + 1;

// Display the results.
Console.WriteLine("Maximum Rows: " + maxRows);
Console.WriteLine("Maximum Columns: " + maxCols);
Console.WriteLine();
```

1. Print a message to indicate we are working with the XLS format.
2. Create a `Workbook` instance for the XLS format using `FileFormatType.Excel97To2003`.
3. Get the maximum rows and columns with `wb.Settings.MaxRow` and `wb.Settings.MaxColumn`, adding 1 since these are zero-based.
4. Output the maximum rows and columns to the console.

## Step 2: Maximum Rows and Columns for XLSX Format

Next, we'll explore the maximum rows and columns supported by the XLSX format.

```csharp
// Print message about XLSX format.
Console.WriteLine("Maximum Rows and Columns supported by XLSX format:");

// Create a workbook in XLSX format.
wb = new Workbook(FileFormatType.Xlsx);

// Retrieve maximum rows and columns.
maxRows = wb.Settings.MaxRow + 1;
maxCols = wb.Settings.MaxColumn + 1;

// Display the results.
Console.WriteLine("Maximum Rows: " + maxRows);
Console.WriteLine("Maximum Columns: " + maxCols);
```

1. Print a message indicating we are working with the XLSX format.
2. Create a `Workbook` instance for the XLSX format using `FileFormatType.Xlsx`.
3. Retrieve and output the maximum rows and columns as before.

## Step 3: Displaying a Success Message

After executing the steps, let’s indicate success.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Execution completed successfully: Maximum Rows and Columns retrieval for both formats.");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use the Aspose.Cells for .NET library to find the maximum rows and columns supported by XLS and XLSX file formats. Understanding these limits is essential for effective Excel data management, ensuring your datasets align with format capabilities.
