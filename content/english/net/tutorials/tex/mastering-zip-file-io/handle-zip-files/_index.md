## Introduction

Aspose.TeX for .NET is a powerful library designed for processing TeX documents. One of its standout features is the ability to handle Zip files efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through using Zip files in your .NET applications with Aspose.TeX.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of the C# programming language.
- A working understanding of Aspose.TeX for .NET.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.

## Required Namespaces

To begin, include the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.TeX.IO;
using Aspose.TeX.Presentation.Pdf;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Open Input and Output ZIP Streams

First, you'll need to open streams for the input and output Zip archives. Replace `"Your Input Directory"` and `"Your Output Directory"` with your specified paths.

```csharp
using (Stream inZipStream = File.Open(Path.Combine("Your Input Directory", "zip-in.zip"), FileMode.Open))
using (Stream outZipStream = File.Open(Path.Combine("Your Output Directory", "zip-pdf-out.zip"), FileMode.Create))
```

## Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options

Next, set up the conversion options for the ObjectTeX format.

```csharp
TeXOptions options = TeXOptions.ConsoleAppOptions(TeXConfig.ObjectTeX());
```

## Step 3: Configure Input and Output Directories

Define the working directories for the input and output Zip archives.

```csharp
options.InputWorkingDirectory = new InputZipDirectory(inZipStream, "in");
options.OutputWorkingDirectory = new OutputZipDirectory(outZipStream);
```

## Step 4: Specify the Output Terminal

Set the console as the output terminal.

```csharp
options.TerminalOut = new OutputConsoleTerminal(); // This is the default setting.
```

## Step 5: Define Saving Options

You can specify the output format for saving. In this tutorial, we will save the output as a PDF.

```csharp
options.SaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
```

## Step 6: Run the TeX Job

Create a `TeXJob`, then run it to process your files.

```csharp
TeXJob job = new TeXJob("hello-world", new PdfDevice(), options);
job.Run();
```

## Step 7: Finalize the Output ZIP Archive

Finally, ensure that the output Zip archive is properly finalized.

```csharp
((OutputZipDirectory)options.OutputWorkingDirectory).Finish();
```

## Conclusion

Integrating Zip file handling into your .NET applications with Aspose.TeX is a straightforward process. By following this guide, you can enhance your document processing capabilities effectively.
