Let’s break down the comparison process into clear steps.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Name

Set where you want to save the comparison results:

string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ComparisonResult.docx");
```

## Step 2: Specify Source and Target Documents

Define the paths for the documents you wish to compare:

string sourcePath = "path/to/YOUR_SOURCE.docx"; // Change to your source document path
string targetPath = "path/to/YOUR_TARGET.docx"; // Change to your target document path
```

## Step 3: Perform Document Comparison

Utilize the `Comparer` class to compare the documents:

```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath))
{
    comparer.Add(targetPath);
    comparer.Compare(outputFileName);
}
```

## Step 4: Display Output Location

After running the comparison, let the user know where to find the results:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocuments compared successfully.\nCheck the output in: {outputDirectory}");
```
