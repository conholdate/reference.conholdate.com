## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, document manipulation is an essential skill. Aspose.Page for .NET is a powerful library that empowers developers to work effortlessly with PostScript (PS) documents. This guide will walk you through the process of adding pages to a PostScript document step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of .NET programming.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- The Aspose.Page for .NET library, which you can download [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).
- A designated directory for your documents for testing purposes.

## Import Necessary Namespaces

To utilize Aspose.Page, you need to include the appropriate namespaces in your project. Here’s how to set it up:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.EPS;
using Aspose.Page.EPS.Device;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Create a new .NET project.
3. Add a reference to the Aspose.Page library in your project.

## Step 2: Initialize the PostScript Document

Set up your PostScript document with the desired configurations:

```csharp
// ExStart:1
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Set your document directory path
using (Stream outPsStream = new FileStream(Path.Combine(dataDir, "document1.ps"), FileMode.Create))
{
    // Set up save options for A4 size
    PsSaveOptions options = new PsSaveOptions();
    
    // Create a new PostScript document with 2 pages
    PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, 2);
```

## Step 3: Add the First Page

Now, you can add your first page and insert content as needed:

```csharp
    // Open the first page for editing
    document.OpenPage();
    
    // Add your content here
    // Example: document.AddText("Hello, World!");

    // Close the first page to save changes
    document.ClosePage();
```

## Step 4: Add a Second Page with Custom Size

You can also create a second page with a different size:

```csharp
    // Open the second page with a custom size (e.g., 400 x 700)
    document.OpenPage(400, 700);
    
    // Add content specific to this page
    // Example: document.AddText("This is a second page!");

    // Close the second page
    document.ClosePage();
```

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save your document to ensure all changes are stored:

```csharp
    // Save the PostScript document
    document.Save();
}
// ExEnd:1
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully added pages to a PostScript document using Aspose.Page for .NET. This library’s intuitive API makes document manipulation straightforward, enhancing your development capabilities.
