## Introduction

When it comes to working with documents in .NET applications, the GroupDocs.Viewer library stands out as a powerful tool. With its extensive features, you can easily manage and manipulate document presentations. But where do you start? This article covers two vital tutorials that will get you up to speed: rendering documents with comments and reordering pages within your documents.

## Render Documents with Comments

First up is the tutorial on Rendering Documents with Comments. Imagine you have a collaborative document where multiple users have left feedback. How do you display these comments alongside the document content in your application? This tutorial breaks it down with clear, actionable steps.

You’ll learn everything from setting up GroupDocs.Viewer in your .NET environment to displaying comments effectively. Not only does it enhance document readability, but it also provides context for changes, making it invaluable for team projects. Engaging with comments directly from the application enhances the user experience, allowing for more interactive document handling.

## Reorder Pages in Documents

Next, let’s talk about the ability to Reorder Pages in Documents. Have you ever wanted to rearrange the flow of a document on the fly? GroupDocs.Viewer makes this simple. This tutorial walks you through the process of rearranging pages within different document formats.

You’ll discover how to implement straightforward UI controls that allow users to drag and drop pages as they see fit. This functionality can be particularly handy when dealing with reports or presentations where the order of information matters greatly. Imagine presenting a project and realizing the pages are out of order — with this tutorial, you won’t have to panic!
