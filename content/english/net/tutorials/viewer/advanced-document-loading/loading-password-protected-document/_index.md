## Introduction

In the digital landscape, the ability to manage and view various document formats is crucial for businesses and individuals. GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET offers a robust solution for developers to integrate document viewing capabilities into their applications effortlessly. This tutorial will guide you through the process of loading password-protected documents step by step, ensuring you can implement this feature seamlessly in your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following:

1. GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET Installed: Download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
2. Password-Protected Document: Have a password-protected document ready for testing.

## Import Required Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define the Output Directory

Specify where you want the rendered output to be saved:

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path you want to use.

## Step 2: Set Up Page File Path Format

Define the format for the file paths of each rendered page:

```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```

This will generate paths like `"Your Document Directory/page_1.html"`, `"Your Document Directory/page_2.html"`, etc.

## Step 3: Configure Load Options

Set up the load options for your password-protected document, including the password:

```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions
{
    Password = "12345"  // Replace with your document's password
};
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Viewer

Create an instance of the GroupDocs.Viewer with your document and the load options:

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("Path_to_your_document", loadOptions))
{
    // Code for viewing options will be added in the next step.
}
```
Make sure to replace `"Path_to_your_document"` with the actual path to your document.

## Step 5: Configure HTML View Options

Set up the HTML view options for rendering the document with embedded resources:

```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```

## Step 6: Render the Document

Now, render the document using the configured viewer and view options:

```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 7: Display a Success Message

Finally, inform the user that the document has been rendered successfully:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
