## Introduction

Interactive PDFs can significantly enhance user engagement, especially when it comes to forms. One of the most effective interactive elements is the radio button, which allows users to select one option from a set. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the steps to create radio buttons in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner, this guide will help you understand each part of the code.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following:

1. Visual Studio: Your development environment.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Download the library from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you navigate the code snippets.

## Create a New Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Create a new Console Application project.

## Add Aspose.PDF Reference

1. Right-click your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for Aspose.PDF and install the latest version.

Now that your environment is set up, let’s dive into the code.

## Step 1: Define Your Document Directory

Specify the directory where your PDF will be saved:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual path
```

## Step 2: Instantiate the Document Object

Create an instance of the `Document` class:

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Add a Page to the PDF

Add a new page to your PDF document:

```csharp
pdfDocument.Pages.Add();
```

## Step 4: Create the Radio Button Field

Instantiate a `RadioButtonField` object for the first page:

```csharp
RadioButtonField radio = new RadioButtonField(pdfDocument.Pages[1]);
```

## Step 5: Add Options to the Radio Button

Define the options for your radio button:

```csharp
radio.AddOption("Option 1", new Rectangle(0, 0, 20, 20));
radio.AddOption("Option 2", new Rectangle(0, 30, 20, 20));
```

This example adds two options: "Option 1" and "Option 2". The `Rectangle` object specifies the position and size of each option.

## Step 6: Add the Radio Button to the Document Form

Integrate the radio button into the PDF form:

```csharp
pdfDocument.Form.Add(radio);
```

## Step 7: Save the PDF Document

Save your PDF document to the specified directory:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "RadioButton_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

## Step 8: Handle Exceptions

Implement error handling to catch any issues:

```csharp
try
{
    // Your PDF creation code here
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
}
```
