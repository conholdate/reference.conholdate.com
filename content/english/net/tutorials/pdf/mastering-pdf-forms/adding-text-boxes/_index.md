## Introduction

In today’s digital landscape, enhancing user experience through interactive documents is essential. Interactive PDF forms not only streamline data collection but also engage users in a way that static documents cannot. Aspose.PDF for .NET is a powerful library designed to help developers integrate various form fields into PDF documents effortlessly. Among these, text boxes are particularly useful for gathering user input in a structured manner. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the process of adding a text box to a PDF using Aspose.PDF for .NET, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of each step.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# syntax and structure will help you follow along with the code.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET Installed: Download and install the Aspose.PDF library from the [site](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Development Environment: Use an IDE like Visual Studio for coding and testing.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure you have a compatible version of the .NET Framework installed.

With these prerequisites in place, we’re ready to jump into the coding!

### Open Your IDE

Launch your preferred development environment (Visual Studio is recommended).

### Create a New Project

Set up a new C# project by selecting "Create a new project" and choosing the Console Application template for simplicity.

### Install the Aspose.PDF Package

Integrate the Aspose.PDF library into your project using NuGet Package Manager. In the Package Manager Console, run:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

## Import the Aspose.PDF Namespace

At the top of your main program file (typically `Program.cs`), include the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf.Forms;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Annotations;
```

This setup prepares you for the exciting tasks ahead!

Now that we have everything ready, let’s break down the steps to add a text box to your PDF document.

## Step 1: Define Your Document Directory

First, specify the directory where your PDF document is located. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Open the PDF Document 

Load the PDF file into an instance of the `Document` class:

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "TextField.pdf");
```

Ensure that `"TextField.pdf"` exists in your specified directory.

## Step 3: Create the Text Box Field

Now, let’s create the text box field:

```csharp
TextBoxField textBoxField = new TextBoxField(pdfDocument.Pages[1], new Aspose.Pdf.Rectangle(100, 200, 300, 300));
```

- A new `TextBoxField` object is initialized for the second page of your PDF.
- The `Rectangle` parameter specifies the position and size of the text box using coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2).

## Step 4: Set Properties for the Text Box Field 

Customize your text box with the following properties:

```csharp
textBoxField.PartialName = "textbox1";
textBoxField.Value = "Text Box";
```

- `PartialName` gives a unique identifier to the text box.
- `Value` sets the default text that appears inside the box.

## Step 5: Customize the Border

Let’s enhance the appearance of our text box by customizing its border:

```csharp
Border border = new Border(textBoxField);
border.Width = 5; 
border.Dash = new Dash(1, 1);
textBoxField.Border = border;
textBoxField.Color = Aspose.Pdf.Color.FromRgb(System.Drawing.Color.Green);
```

- Creates a border and sets its width.
- Applies a dashed style to the border.
- Assigns a green color to the text box.

## Step 6: Add the Text Box to the Document

Now, we’ll add the text box field to our PDF document:

```csharp
pdfDocument.Form.Add(textBoxField, 1);
```

This line incorporates the text box into the first page of the PDF.

## Step 7: Save the Modified PDF

Finally, save your changes with the following code:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "TextBox_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nTextbox field added successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

This snippet saves the modified PDF under a new name. Check the output path for your newly created PDF!
