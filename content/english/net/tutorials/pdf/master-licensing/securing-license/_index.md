## Introduction

In software development, ensuring that your applications function smoothly and efficiently is crucial. A significant aspect of this is managing licenses for the libraries and frameworks you utilize. If you're working with Aspose.PDF for .NET, securing your license is essential to unlock the library's full potential. This guide will walk you through the process of securing a license using Aspose.PDF for .NET, making it straightforward for both seasoned developers and newcomers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Visual Studio: Installed on your machine for writing and executing .NET code.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Download the library from the [Aspose PDF Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code.
4. License File: Obtain your Aspose license file. If you don’t have one, you can request a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for testing.

## Importing Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your C# project:

1. Open your Visual Studio project.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for Aspose.PDF and install the latest version.

Once installed, you’re ready to write the code to secure your license.

## Step 1: Create a New C# File

Create a new C# file in your project, naming it `SecureLicense.cs`. This file will contain the code necessary to secure your license.

## Step 2: Add Using Directives

At the top of your `SecureLicense.cs` file, add the following using directives to access the required classes and methods from the Aspose library:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Ionic.Zip;
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Secure License

Now, let's initialize the secure license using the `SecureLicense` class. Here’s how to do it:

```csharp
using (Stream zip = new SecureLicense().GetType().Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("Aspose.Total.lic.zip"))
{
    using (ZipFile zf = ZipFile.Read(zip))
    {
        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
        ZipEntry e = zf["Aspose.Total.lic"];
        e.ExtractWithPassword(ms, "test");
        ms.Position = 0;

        // Load the License
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense(ms);
    }
}
```

- Stream zip: Initializes a stream to read the embedded license file.
- ZipFile zf: Creates an instance of `ZipFile` to read the contents of the zip file.
- MemoryStream ms: Holds the extracted license file.
- ZipEntry e: Retrieves the specific license entry from the zip file.
- ExtractWithPassword: Extracts the license file using the provided password.
- License license: Creates a new instance of the `License` class and loads the license from the memory stream.

## Step 4: Test the License

After setting the license, it's time to verify that everything is working correctly. You can do this by creating a simple PDF document and checking if the license is applied. Here’s an example:

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
pdfDocument.Pages.Add();
pdfDocument.Save("TestDocument.pdf");
```

- Document pdfDocument: Creates a new PDF document.
- pdfDocument.Pages.Add(): Adds a new page to the document.
- pdfDocument.Save(): Saves the document to the specified path.
