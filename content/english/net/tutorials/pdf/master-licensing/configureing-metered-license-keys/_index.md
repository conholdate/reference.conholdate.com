## Introduction

Are you ready to explore the capabilities of PDF manipulation with Aspose.PDF for .NET? Whether you're managing extensive document workflows or simply need to work with a few PDFs, configuring a metered license is your gateway to maximizing the potential of Aspose.PDF. In this guide, we'll walk you through the straightforward process of setting up metered license keys in your PDF files. Let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Download and install the latest version from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
2. Valid Metered License Keys: Obtain your metered public and private keys. If you don’t have them yet, request a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. Development Environment: Set up Visual Studio or another compatible .NET development environment.
4. Sample PDF Document: Have a PDF file available for testing the configuration.

## Import Required Packages

To work with Aspose.PDF, you need to include the necessary namespaces in your project. This allows you to access all the required classes and methods.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Let’s break down the configuration process into clear steps to ensure you don’t miss anything.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Open Visual Studio: Launch Visual Studio and create a new C# project. If you have an existing project, open it.
2. Add Reference to Aspose.PDF: Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer, select "Manage NuGet Packages," search for "Aspose.PDF for .NET," and install it.

## Step 2: Initialize the Metered Class

Now that your environment is ready, initialize the `Metered` class provided by Aspose.PDF.

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Metered metered = new Aspose.Pdf.Metered();
```

- Why This Matters: The `Metered` class is essential for utilizing the metered licensing model, which can be more economical for high-volume document processing.

## Step 3: Set Your Metered License Keys

With the `Metered` class initialized, it’s time to apply your metered public and private keys.

```csharp
metered.SetMeteredKey("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
```

- Important Note: Replace `"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"` and `"YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"` with your actual keys. These are crucial for activating the full capabilities of Aspose.PDF.

## Step 4: Load Your PDF Document

Next, load the PDF document you want to work with.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

- Loading the Document: The `Document` class in Aspose.PDF allows for easy loading and manipulation of PDF files.

## Step 5: Verify the Configuration

Let’s ensure that the metered license has been configured correctly.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(doc.Pages.Count);
```

- Why This Step Matters: Checking the page count confirms that the document is accessible and the license is functioning as expected.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured metered license keys for your PDF files using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This setup not only unlocks the full potential of the Aspose.PDF library but also prepares you for efficient large-scale PDF processing tasks.
