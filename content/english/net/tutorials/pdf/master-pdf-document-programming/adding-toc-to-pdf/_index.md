## Introduction

Creating a table of contents (TOC) in a PDF document can greatly enhance its navigation and accessibility. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to add a TOC to a PDF file using Aspose.Pdf for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1.  Aspose.PDF for .NET: Download and install the latest version from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
2.  Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment like Visual Studio.
3.  License: Request a temporary license if needed; please visit [Aspose.Pdf Licensing Page](https://asposepdf.com/developers) for more information.

Importing Necessary Libraries

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load the PDF Document

Load your existing PDF file where you want to add the TOC. Specify the path to your document directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "AddTOC.pdf");
```

## Step 2: Insert a New Page for TOC

Insert a new page at the beginning of the PDF document. This page will serve as the Table of Contents (TOC).

```csharp
Page tocPage = doc.Pages.Insert(1);
```

## Step 3: Create a TOC Information Object

Create an object that will represent the TOC information. Add a title and link to it for better navigation.

```csharp
TocInfo tocInfo = new TocInfo();
TextFragment title = new TextFragment("Table Of Contents");
title.TextState.FontSize = 20;
title.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold;
tocInfo.Title = title;
tocPage.TocInfo = tocInfo;
```

## Step 4: Define TOC Elements

Define the elements (or headings) that will be displayed in the TOC. These elements can help readers navigate to specific sections of the document.

```csharp
string[] titles = new string[4];
titles[0] = "First page";
titles[1] = "Second page";
titles[2] = "Third page";
titles[3] = "Fourth page";
```

## Step 5: Create TOC Headings

Create headings for the first two elements in the TOC. These headings will link to their respective pages.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
{
    Aspose.Pdf.Heading heading2 = new Aspose.Pdf.Heading(1);
    TextSegment segment2 = new TextSegment();
    heading2.TocPage = tocPage;
    heading2.Segments.Add(segment2);

    heading2.DestinationPage = doc.Pages[i + 2];
    heading2.Top = doc.Pages[i + 2].Rect.Height;
    segment2.Text = titles[i];

    tocPage.Paragraphs.Add(heading2);
}
```

## Step 6: Save the PDF with the TOC

Finally, save the updated PDF file.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "TOC_out.pdf";
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

## Confirmation Message

Display a confirmation message to let the user know that the process is complete.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nTOC added successfully to an existing PDF.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```
