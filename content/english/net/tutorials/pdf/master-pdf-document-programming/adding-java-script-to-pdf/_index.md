## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide to adding interactive elements like pop-up alerts or auto-print functions to PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By leveraging the capabilities of this library, you can create dynamic and engaging PDFs that cater to various user needs.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that you have downloaded the latest version of Aspose.PDF for .NET from [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/) or obtained a free trial through their website: [releases.aspose.com](http://releases.aspose.com).

You should also have a basic understanding of C# and be familiar with the development environment you are using. Additionally, if you need to avoid limitations during your development process, consider acquiring a temporary license from Aspose.

## Importing Necessary Packages
To begin writing code, import the required namespaces from the Aspose.PDF library:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Annotations;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
```

## Step 1: Loading an Existing PDF
Load an existing PDF document to which you want to add interactive elements:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your PDF file.

## Step 2: Adding JavaScript at the Document Level

To apply a script that triggers when the document opens, instantiate a `JavascriptAction` object:

```csharp
JavascriptAction javaScript = new JavascriptAction("this.print({bUI:true,bSilent:false,bShrinkToFit:true});");
doc.OpenAction = javaScript;
```

## Step 3: Adding JavaScript at the Page Level

To trigger specific actions based on page openings or closings, instantiate a `JavascriptAction` object for each page:

```csharp
doc.Pages[2].Actions.OnOpen = new JavascriptAction("app.alert('Page 2 opened')");
doc.Pages[2].Actions.OnClose = new JavascriptAction("app.alert('Page 2 closed')");
```

## Step 4: Saving the PDF Document

To save the modified PDF document, specify the output file path:

```csharp
string dataDir = dataDir + "JavaScript-Added_out.pdf";
doc.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nJavaScript added successfully to the PDF.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

## Conclusion
By following this guide and utilizing Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can effectively enhance your PDFs with interactive elements. This library offers a comprehensive solution for creating dynamic and engaging documents that cater to various user needs.
