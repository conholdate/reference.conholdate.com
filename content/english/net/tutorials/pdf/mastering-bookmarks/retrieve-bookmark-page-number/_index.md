## Introduction

In the digital age, managing PDF documents efficiently is crucial for both personal and professional use. Whether you're a developer enhancing your application or a business professional organizing documents, mastering PDF manipulation can save you time and effort. One essential feature is extracting bookmarks and their corresponding page numbers. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll explore how to achieve this using Aspose.PDF for .NET, a powerful library designed for seamless PDF manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio on your machine, as it will serve as your development environment.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Download the Aspose.PDF library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets effectively.

## Step 1: Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages into your C# project:

1. Open your Visual Studio project.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for `Aspose.PDF` and install the latest version.

## Step 2: Specify Your Document Directory

Before extracting bookmarks, specify the path to your PDF document. This is where your PDF file is located.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your PDF file is stored. This path is crucial for locating the PDF file you want to work with.

## Step 3: Create a PdfBookmarkEditor Instance

Next, create an instance of the `PdfBookmarkEditor` class, which provides methods to manipulate bookmarks in PDF files.

```csharp
// Create PdfBookmarkEditor
PdfBookmarkEditor bookmarkEditor = new PdfBookmarkEditor();
```

## Step 4: Open the PDF File

Now, bind the PDF file to the `PdfBookmarkEditor` instance you just created.

```csharp
// Open PDF file
bookmarkEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "GetBookmarks.pdf");
```

Ensure that the file `GetBookmarks.pdf` exists in the specified directory; otherwise, you will encounter an error.

## Step 5: Extract Bookmarks

With the PDF file opened, you can now extract the bookmarks using the `ExtractBookmarks` method.

```csharp
// Extract bookmarks
Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Bookmarks bookmarks = bookmarkEditor.ExtractBookmarks();
```

This retrieves all bookmarks from the PDF file and stores them in a variable called `bookmarks`.

## Step 6: Iterate Through Bookmarks

Now that you have the bookmarks, loop through them to display their titles and page numbers:

```csharp
foreach (Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Bookmark bookmark in bookmarks)
{
    string strLevelSeparator = new string('-', bookmark.Level * 4);
    Console.WriteLine($"{strLevelSeparator} Title: {bookmark.Title}");
    Console.WriteLine($"{strLevelSeparator} Page Number: {bookmark.PageNumber}");
    Console.WriteLine($"{strLevelSeparator} Page Action: {bookmark.Action}");
}
```

In this loop, we create a visual separator based on the bookmark level to represent the hierarchy clearly. We then print the title, page number, and action associated with each bookmark.

## Conclusion

Extracting bookmark page numbers from a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET is a straightforward and efficient process. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effectively manage bookmarks in your PDF documents. Whether you're developing an application or simply organizing your PDFs, this knowledge will undoubtedly enhance your productivity.
