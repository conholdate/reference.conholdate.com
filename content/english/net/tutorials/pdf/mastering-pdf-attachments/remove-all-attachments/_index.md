## Introduction

Have you ever needed to clean up a PDF file by removing attachments? Whether for privacy, file size reduction, or just a tidier document, knowing how to delete attachments is a valuable skill. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of removing attachments from a PDF using the powerful Aspose.PDF library for .NET. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.PDF library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
2. Visual Studio: A development environment suitable for running .NET applications.
3. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# will help you understand the following code snippets.

## Step 1: Create a New Console Application

Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application. This format is straightforward and ideal for our needs.

## Step 2: Add Aspose.PDF to Your Project

1. Right-click your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for Aspose.PDF and install the latest version.

## Step 3: Import Required Namespaces

At the top of your `Program.cs` file, include the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Step 4: Specify Your Document Directory

Next, you'll need to set the path to your PDF file:

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

Note: Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your PDF file is located.

## Step 5: Open the PDF Document

Use the following code to open your PDF document:

```csharp
// Open the PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "DeleteAllAttachments.pdf");
```

Make sure the file name matches the one you have in your directory.

## Step 6: Remove All Attachments

Here comes the exciting part! You can delete all embedded attachments with a single method call:

```csharp
// Delete all attachments
pdfDocument.EmbeddedFiles.Delete();
```

This line removes all attached files from your PDF seamlessly.

## Step 7: Save the Modified Document

After deleting the attachments, save the updated PDF using:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "DeleteAllAttachments_out.pdf";
// Save the updated PDF
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

This will save the modified document under a new name, preserving the original file for backup.

## Step 8: Confirmation Message

Lastly, display a confirmation message in the console to indicate success:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nAll attachments deleted successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

This statement confirms that the attachments have been deleted and indicates where the new file is saved.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve just learned how to remove all attachments from a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. With this knowledge, you can now manage your PDF documents more effectively, whether for personal or professional use.
