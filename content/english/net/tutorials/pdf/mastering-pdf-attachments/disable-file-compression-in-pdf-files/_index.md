## Introduction

Efficient PDF management has become an essential skill in both professional and personal contexts. One key aspect is controlling the behavior of embedded files, particularly when it comes to compression. Disabling file compression in PDF documents ensures that embedded files retain their original quality and format. This guide will walk you through the process of disabling file compression in PDFs using the robust features of Aspose.PDF for .NET.

## Prerequisites

To implement the steps in this guide, you will need the following:

- Aspose.PDF for .NET: Ensure you have the library installed. You can get it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).  
- Development Environment: Use Visual Studio or a similar IDE to work with .NET projects.
- C# Knowledge: A basic understanding of C# programming is required.

## Importing Necessary Libraries and Setting Up the Environment

1. Create a New Project: Open Visual Studio and start a new Console Application project.
2. Add Aspose.PDF NuGet Package:
   - Right-click the project in the Solution Explorer.
   - Select Manage NuGet Packages.
   - Search for Aspose.PDF and install the latest version.
3. Import Required Namespaces:
   Add the following namespaces at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

Start by specifying the directory path where your input PDF file is located. This ensures the application knows where to find the file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the PDF Document

Use the `Document` class to load the PDF file you want to manipulate.

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "InputFile.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Create a File Specification for the Attachment

Prepare the file to be added as an attachment. The `FileSpecification` class allows you to define file properties, such as the description and encoding.

```csharp
FileSpecification fileSpecification = new FileSpecification("SampleFile.txt", "Sample text file");
```

## Step 4: Disable Compression for the File

Set the `Encoding` property to `FileEncoding.None`. This ensures that the file is added without compression.

```csharp
fileSpecification.Encoding = FileEncoding.None;
```

## Step 5: Attach the File to the PDF Document

Add the prepared file to the PDF documentâ€™s `EmbeddedFiles` collection.

```csharp
pdfDocument.EmbeddedFiles.Add(fileSpecification);
```

## Step 6: Save the Modified PDF

Specify the output path and save the updated PDF file.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "DisableFilesCompression_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

## Step 7: Confirm Success

Optionally, print a confirmation message to the console to verify the operation.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("File compression disabled and PDF saved at: " + outputFile);
```
