## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced digital environment, effectively managing documents is essential. A common task is extracting links from PDF files. Whether you're a developer integrating PDF functionalities into your application or simply looking to streamline your digital document management, a powerful library like Aspose.PDF for .NET can make this process straightforward. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through extracting links from a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET, breaking it down into easy-to-follow steps. Let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, ensure you have the following set up:

1. .NET Environment: You should have a .NET development environment ready, such as Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
2. Aspose.PDF Library: Install the Aspose.PDF library via NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio. Run the following command:
```bash
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```
Alternatively, you can download the latest version directly from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic C# Knowledge: A fundamental understanding of C# will help you follow along easily. Don’t worry if you’re new; we’ll keep things clear!
4. Sample PDF Document: You’ll need a PDF file containing links. You can create one or download sample PDFs from the internet.

With everything set up, let’s get started!

## Import Necessary Namespaces

Once your environment is ready, import the required namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Annotations;
using System.Collections;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

## Step 1: Specify the Data Directory

First, specify the path to your PDF document. This is where your application will look for the file:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your PDF file.

## Step 2: Open the PDF Document

Next, open the PDF document using Aspose.PDF:

```csharp
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "ExtractLinks.pdf");
```

Make sure to replace `"ExtractLinks.pdf"` with the name of your PDF file.

## Step 3: Select the Target Page

PDFs can have multiple pages, so specify which page you want to extract links from. For example, to extract links from the first page:

```csharp
Page page = document.Pages[1]; // Pages are indexed starting from 1
```

## Step 4: Set Up the Link Annotation Selector

Now, create a selector to grab all link annotations on the page:

```csharp
AnnotationSelector selector = new AnnotationSelector(new LinkAnnotation(page, Aspose.Pdf.Rectangle.Trivial));
```

This line tells Aspose.PDF to focus on link annotations within the specified page.

## Step 5: Accept the Selector

Let the page know to accept the selector and find the relevant annotations:

```csharp
page.Accept(selector);
```

## Step 6: Retrieve the List of Annotations

Collect all the links extracted:

```csharp
IList<Annotation> list = selector.Selected;
```

## Step 7: Extract and Display the Links

Now, you can extract the links and display them. Here’s how:

```csharp
if (list.Count > 0) // Ensure there are links before accessing them
{
    foreach (Annotation annotation in list)
    {
        // Display each link's title
        Console.WriteLine("Extracted Link: " + annotation.Title);
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("No links found on this page.");
}

// Save the document (optional)
dataDir = dataDir + "ExtractLinks_out.pdf";
document.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nLinks extracted successfully. File saved at " + dataDir);
```

In this snippet, we check if any annotations were found. If so, we loop through the list and print each link's title. Finally, we save the document, creating a new file with the extracted links.

## Conclusion
