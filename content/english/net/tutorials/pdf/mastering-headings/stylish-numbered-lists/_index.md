## Introduction

Have you ever needed to create well-structured, numbered lists in your PDF documents? Whether it's for legal papers, reports, or presentations, effective numbering styles are crucial for organizing your content. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily apply various numbering styles to your PDF headings, resulting in polished and professional documents.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the coding, ensure you have the following ready:

1. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Download the latest version from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
2. Development Environment: You’ll need Visual Studio or any .NET-compatible IDE.
3. .NET Framework: Make sure you have .NET Framework 4.0 or higher installed.
4. License: You can use a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or explore the [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) options.

## Importing Required Packages

Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your project:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document

Let’s begin by creating a new PDF document and configuring its layout, including page size and margins.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDoc = new Document();

// Set page dimensions and margins
pdfDoc.PageInfo.Width = 612.0; // 8.5 inches
pdfDoc.PageInfo.Height = 792.0; // 11 inches
pdfDoc.PageInfo.Margin = new Aspose.Pdf.MarginInfo(72, 72, 72, 72); // 1 inch margins
```

This setup gives your document a standard letter size with one-inch margins on all sides.

## Step 2: Adding a Page to the PDF

Next, we’ll add a blank page to the PDF document, where we will later apply the numbering styles.

```csharp
// Add a new page to the PDF document
Aspose.Pdf.Page pdfPage = pdfDoc.Pages.Add();
pdfPage.PageInfo = pdfDoc.PageInfo; // Use the same settings as the document
```

## Step 3: Creating a Floating Box

A FloatingBox allows you to position content independently of the page’s flow, giving you greater control over your layout.

```csharp
// Create a FloatingBox for structured content
Aspose.Pdf.FloatingBox floatBox = new Aspose.Pdf.FloatingBox
{
    Margin = pdfPage.PageInfo.Margin
};
pdfPage.Paragraphs.Add(floatBox);
```

## Step 4: Adding Headings with Roman Numerals

Now, let’s add our first heading with lower-case Roman numeral numbering.

```csharp
// Create the first heading with Roman numerals
Aspose.Pdf.Heading heading1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Heading(1)
{
    IsInList = true,
    StartNumber = 1,
    Text = "List 1",
    Style = NumberingStyle.NumeralsRomanLowercase,
    IsAutoSequence = true
};
floatBox.Paragraphs.Add(heading1);
```

## Step 5: Adding a Second Heading with Custom Starting Number

Next, we’ll add a second heading, starting from Roman numeral 13.

```csharp
// Create a second heading starting at Roman numeral 13
Aspose.Pdf.Heading heading2 = new Aspose.Pdf.Heading(1)
{
    IsInList = true,
    StartNumber = 13,
    Text = "List 2",
    Style = NumberingStyle.NumeralsRomanLowercase,
    IsAutoSequence = true
};
floatBox.Paragraphs.Add(heading2);
```

## Step 6: Adding a Heading with Alphabetical Numbering

For variety, let’s add a third heading using alphabetical numbering in lowercase.

```csharp
// Create a heading with alphabetical numbering
Aspose.Pdf.Heading heading3 = new Aspose.Pdf.Heading(2)
{
    IsInList = true,
    StartNumber = 1,
    Text = "The value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of each allowed",
    Style = NumberingStyle.LettersLowercase,
    IsAutoSequence = true
};
floatBox.Paragraphs.Add(heading3);
```

## Step 7: Saving the PDF

Finally, let’s save the PDF file to your desired directory.

```csharp
// Save the PDF document
dataDir = dataDir + "ApplyNumberStyle_out.pdf";
pdfDoc.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine($"\nNumber style applied successfully in headings.\nFile saved at {dataDir}");
```
