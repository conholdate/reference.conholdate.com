## Introduction

Are you a .NET developer eager to integrate DGN files into your applications? Aspose.CAD for .NET offers a powerful library designed specifically for working with DGN file formats. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to efficiently handle DGN files, including supported elements and how to manipulate them in your .NET projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following setup:

- Basic knowledge of .NET programming: Familiarity with C# or VB.NET will be beneficial.
- Visual Studio: Installed on your machine for project development.
- Aspose.CAD for .NET library: Download it from [Aspose.CAD](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/).

## Step 1: Import Necessary Namespaces

To leverage the functionalities of Aspose.CAD, start by importing the required namespaces into your project.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aspose.CAD;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Dgn;
using Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Dgn.DgnElements;
```

## Step 2: Load Your DGN File

Begin by loading an existing DGN file into your application. This is done by instantiating a `DgnImage`.

```csharp
string myDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = myDir + "Nikon_D90_Camera.dgn";

using (DgnImage dgnImage = (DgnImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Proceed with your logic here
}
```

## Step 3: Iterate Through DGN Elements

Once the DGN file is loaded, you can iterate through its elements. Aspose.CAD provides a variety of DGN element types for your manipulation.

```csharp
foreach (DgnDrawingElementBase element in dgnImage.Elements)
{
    // Process each element
}
```

## Step 4: Handle 2D and 3D Entities

You can differentiate between 2D and 3D DGN elements. Below is how to handle them efficiently:

### Handle 2D Entities

You can manage previously supported 2D entities with a switch-case block.

```csharp
switch (element.Metadata.Type)
{
    case DgnElementType.Line:
    case DgnElementType.Ellipse:
    case DgnElementType.Curve:
        // Add your processing logic here 
        break;
}
```

### Handle 3D Entities

Similarly, handle 3D entities as follows:

```csharp
switch (element.Metadata.Type)
{
    case DgnElementType.SolidHeader3D:
    case DgnElementType.Cone:
    case DgnElementType.CellHeader:
        // Add your processing logic here 
        break;
}
```

## Step 5: Export the DGN File

After manipulating the DGN elements, you may want to export the file as a raster image. This can easily be accomplished with Aspose.CAD.

```csharp
string outputFilePath = myDir + "Exported_Image.png"; // Define your output path
dgnImage.Save(outputFilePath, new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.PngOptions());
Console.WriteLine($"\nThe DGN file exported successfully to raster image.\nFile saved at {outputFilePath}");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use Aspose.CAD for .NET to effectively manage DGN files. By following the outlined steps, you can effortlessly handle both 2D and 3D DGN elements and export them as raster images. This powerful library enables seamless integration of DGN processing into your .NET applications, enhancing your project capabilities.
