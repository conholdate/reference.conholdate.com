## Introduction

Efficiently managing and organizing various document formats is critical in today's digital landscape. Aspose.Words for .NET provides a robust solution to detect and process different file types. In this guide, we delve into the step-by-step process of detecting document formats, ensuring accuracy and saving valuable time.

## Prerequisites for Document Detection

Before we start, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET Library  
   Download the library from [Aspose Words Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) and activate it using a valid license. For temporary licenses, visit [Aspose Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

2. Development Environment  
   Use Visual Studio (any recent version) with .NET Framework installed.

3. Basic File Setup  
   Organize your input files and prepare directories for sorting detected formats.

## Import Essential Namespaces

Include these namespaces at the start of your program:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.FileFormats;
using Aspose.Words.FileFormats.Util;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
```

These imports provide access to necessary classes and methods for file format detection.

## Step 1: Initialize Directories for Organized Output

Create directories for storing files based on their detected format.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/";
string supportedDir = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Supported");
string unknownDir = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Unknown");
string encryptedDir = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Encrypted");
string pre97Dir = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Pre97");

// Ensure directories exist
Directory.CreateDirectory(supportedDir);
Directory.CreateDirectory(unknownDir);
Directory.CreateDirectory(encryptedDir);
Directory.CreateDirectory(pre97Dir);
```

This structure simplifies file management.

## Step 2: Retrieve File List

Filter out corrupted or unsupported documents to streamline processing.

```csharp
IEnumerable<string> fileList = Directory.GetFiles(dataDir)
    .Where(fileName => !fileName.EndsWith("Corrupted document.docx"));
```

The filtered list ensures you work only with valid files.

## Step 3: Detect and Categorize File Formats

Loop through each file to identify its format and move it to the appropriate directory.

```csharp
foreach (string fileName in fileList)
{
    string nameOnly = Path.GetFileName(fileName);
    Console.WriteLine($"Processing file: {nameOnly}");

    FileFormatInfo fileInfo = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat(fileName);

    // Output detected format
    Console.WriteLine($"Detected Format: {fileInfo.LoadFormat}");
    if (fileInfo.IsEncrypted)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This file is encrypted.");
        File.Copy(fileName, Path.Combine(encryptedDir, nameOnly), true);
    }
    else
    {
        switch (fileInfo.LoadFormat)
        {
            case LoadFormat.DocPreWord60:
                File.Copy(fileName, Path.Combine(pre97Dir, nameOnly), true);
                break;
            case LoadFormat.Unknown:
                File.Copy(fileName, Path.Combine(unknownDir, nameOnly), true);
                break;
            default:
                File.Copy(fileName, Path.Combine(supportedDir, nameOnly), true);
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

The `FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat` method is central to identifying the document's characteristics.
