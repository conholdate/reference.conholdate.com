## Introduction

Have you ever encountered an encrypted Word document and wondered how to verify its encryption status programmatically? If so, you're in the right place! In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to accomplish this using the Aspose.Words library for .NET. Follow along as we guide you through the setup and code to get your verification done smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, let’s ensure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: Download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
- .NET Framework: Make sure you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine.
- IDE: An Integrated Development Environment like Visual Studio.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you follow this tutorial easily.

## Step 1: Import Required Namespaces

To get started, you’ll need to import the necessary namespaces. Add the following line to your code:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 2: Define the Document Directory

Next, specify the path to the directory where your documents are stored. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Detect the File Format

Now, we’ll use the `DetectFileFormat` method from the `FileFormatUtil` class to gather information about the file format. For this example, we assume the encrypted document is named "Encrypted.docx" and is located in the specified directory:

```csharp
FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat(dataDir + "Encrypted.docx");
```

## Step 4: Check if the Document is Encrypted

To determine if the document is encrypted, we can use the `IsEncrypted` property of the `FileFormatInfo` object. This property returns `true` if the document is encrypted, and `false` otherwise. We’ll display the result in the console:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Is the document encrypted? {info.IsEncrypted}");
```

## Conclusion

And that’s it! You’ve successfully verified the encryption status of a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. It’s impressive how a few lines of code can simplify such tasks.
