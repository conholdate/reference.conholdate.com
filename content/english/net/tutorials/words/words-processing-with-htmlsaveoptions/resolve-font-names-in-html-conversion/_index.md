## Introduction

Hey there, fellow coder! If you've ever struggled with font issues when saving Word documents as HTML, you're not alone. Fonts can be tricky, but don't worry; this guide will help you resolve font names in your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. Let’s dive into the process step-by-step to ensure your fonts look just right in HTML format.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. A Valid License: Purchase a license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or get a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET: Familiarity with basic programming concepts in C# is assumed.
4. Visual Studio: Any version that supports the .NET framework will work.

Now that we have our prerequisites sorted, let’s jump into the action!

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

Before coding, ensure you’ve imported the necessary namespaces into your project. This is crucial for accessing Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document Directory

First, let’s set up the path to your document directory, which is where your Word document is located and where you’ll save your output.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

Here, `dataDir` holds the path to your document directory. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path on your system.

## Step 2: Loading the Word Document

Next, we need to load the Word document that we want to process. This document should contain the fonts you want to resolve.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "MissingFont.docx");
```

We create a `Document` object and load the Word document named "MissingFont.docx" from our `dataDir`.

## Step 3: Configuring HTML Save Options

Now, let’s set up the options for saving the document as HTML, ensuring that font names are resolved correctly.

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Html)
{
    PrettyFormat = true,
    ResolveFontNames = true
};
```

We create an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` with `SaveFormat.Html`. The `PrettyFormat` option makes the HTML output more readable, and `ResolveFontNames` ensures that font names are resolved.

## Step 4: Saving the Document as HTML

Finally, we save the document as an HTML file using the configured save options.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ResolvedFontNames.html", saveOptions);
```

We call the `Save` method on the `Document` object, specifying the output path and the save options we configured. This generates an HTML file with the font names resolved.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you’ve successfully resolved font names when converting a Word document to HTML using Aspose.Words for .NET. This not only ensures your fonts are displayed correctly but also makes your HTML output look polished and professional. Happy coding!
