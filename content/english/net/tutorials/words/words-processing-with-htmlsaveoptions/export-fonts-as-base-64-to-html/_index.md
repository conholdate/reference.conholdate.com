Let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following:

- Aspose.Words for .NET Library: Download it from the [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) page.
- .NET Development Environment: You can use any IDE, but Visual Studio is recommended for its extensive features.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you understand the code snippets provided.

## Import Namespaces

To use Aspose.Words for .NET, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code. This makes all the classes and methods available for use.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

### 1.1 Create a New Project

- Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project. Name it something intuitive, like `ExportFontsBase64`.

### 1.2 Install Aspose.Words

You can install the Aspose.Words library via the NuGet Package Manager:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for Aspose.Words and install it.

Alternatively, you can use the Package Manager Console to run:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Words
```

## Step 2: Load Your Word Document

Next, let’s load the Word document from which you want to export fonts.

### 2.1 Define the Document Directory

Set the path to your document directory:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Make sure you replace the path with your actual directory.

### 2.2 Load the Document

Use the `Document` class to load your Word file:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

Ensure that `Rendering.docx` is located in your specified directory.

## Step 3: Configure HTML Save Options

To export the fonts as Base64, you’ll need to configure the `HtmlSaveOptions`:

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions 
{ 
    ExportFontsAsBase64 = true 
};
```

## Step 4: Save the Document as HTML

Now, save the document using the configured options:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ExportedFontsAsBase64.html", saveOptions);
```

This command saves your document as an HTML file with fonts embedded as Base64, ensuring they render correctly in any browser.
