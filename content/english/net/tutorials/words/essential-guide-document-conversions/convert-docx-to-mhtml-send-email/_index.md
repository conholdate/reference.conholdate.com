## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, converting documents between formats and emailing them is a common task. This guide will walk you through converting a DOCX file to MHTML format and sending it via email using the powerful Aspose.Words and Aspose.Email libraries for .NET. We'll break down each step clearly, ensuring you can follow along with ease. Letâ€™s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the process, ensure you have the following set up:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download and install the library from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Aspose.Email for .NET: Download and install this library from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/email/net/).
3. .NET Framework: Ensure that you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine.
4. SMTP Server: You will need access to an SMTP server to send emails.

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

To utilize Aspose.Words and Aspose.Email in your project, you must import the required namespaces. Add the following using directives at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
using Aspose.Email;
using Aspose.Email.Mime;
using Aspose.Email.Clients.Smtp;
```

## Step 1: Load the DOCX Document

Begin by loading the DOCX document you wish to convert. Use the `Document` class from Aspose.Words to accomplish this.

```csharp
// Specify the path to your document directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 2: Save the Document as MHTML

Next, convert the loaded document into MHTML format. This is done using the `Save` method of the `Document` class.

```csharp
using (Stream stream = new MemoryStream())
{
    doc.Save(stream, SaveFormat.Mhtml);
    // Reset the stream position to the beginning for reading.
    stream.Position = 0;
}
```

## Step 3: Create an Email Message

Now, create an email message from the MHTML stream using Aspose.Email. You will utilize the `MailMessage` class for this purpose.

```csharp
// Load the MHTML stream into an Aspose.Email MIME email message.
MailMessage message = MailMessage.Load(stream, new MhtmlLoadOptions());
message.From = "your_from@email.com";
message.To = "your_to@email.com";
message.Subject = "Aspose.Words + Aspose.Email MHTML Test Message";
```

## Step 4: Send the Email

Finally, send the email using an SMTP client. Configure the SMTP client with your server details and use the `Send` method to dispatch the message.

```csharp
// Configure and send the message using Aspose.Email.
using (SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient())
{
    client.Host = "your_smtp.com";
    client.Send(message);
}
```
