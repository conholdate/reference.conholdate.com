## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! Have you ever found yourself grappling with picture bullets in Word documents? It’s one of those small details that can significantly impact your document's appearance. Today, I’ll guide you through the process of managing picture bullets in Aspose.Words for .NET, specifically focusing on the "Do Not Save Picture Bullet" feature. Let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download and install this robust library from [Aspose's website](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: A working .NET environment, such as Visual Studio.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will be beneficial.
4. Sample Document: A Word document containing image bullets for testing.

Let’s break down the process into clear steps to make it easy to follow.

## Step 1: Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Document Directory

Next, specify the path to your documents directory. This is where you’ll load your Word document and save the modified version.

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENTS_DIRECTORY";
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENTS_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path on your system.

## Step 3: Load the Document

Load the Word document that contains image bullets. This document will be modified to exclude picture bullets upon saving.

```csharp
// Load the document with image bullets
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Image bullet points.docx");
```

Ensure that the file `"Image bullet points.docx"` exists in the specified directory.

## Step 4: Configure Save Options

Now, configure the save options to specify that picture bullets should not be saved. This is where the magic occurs!

```csharp
// Configure save options to omit picture bullets
DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions { SavePictureBullet = false };
```

Setting `SavePictureBullet` to `false` instructs Aspose.Words not to include picture bullets in the output document.

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the document using the configured options. This will generate a new file without the picture bullets.

```csharp
// Save the document with the specified options
doc.Save(dataDir + "Output_Without_Picture_Bullets.docx", saveOptions);
```

The new file, `"Output_Without_Picture_Bullets.docx"`, will be saved in your documents directory.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! With just a few lines of code, you’ve successfully configured Aspose.Words for .NET to omit picture bullets when saving documents. This feature is incredibly useful for achieving a clean and consistent document appearance.
