## Introduction

Welcome to the fascinating world of Aspose.Words for .NET! Today, we're embarking on a journey to explore how to utilize fonts from the target machine when working with Word documents. This feature ensures that your documents maintain their intended appearance, no matter where they're viewed. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Ensure you have the library installed. If you haven't done so, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: A .NET development environment like Visual Studio is essential.
3. Document to Work With: Have a Word document ready for testing, such as "Bullet points with alternative font.docx".

With these prerequisites in place, let’s jump into the code!

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

To get started, we need to import the required namespaces. This step connects all the components of our project.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Load the Word Document

The first step is to load your Word document using the `Document` class from the Aspose.Words library.

### Step 1.1: Define the Document Path

Begin by defining the path to your documents directory:

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

### Step 1.2: Load the Document

Now, load the document:

```csharp
// Load the Word document
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Bullet points with alternative font.docx");
```

## Step 2: Configure Save Options

Next, we need to set up the save options to ensure that the fonts used in your document come from the target machine. We’ll create an instance of `HtmlFixedSaveOptions` and set the `UseTargetMachineFonts` property to `true`.

```csharp
// Configure save options to use fonts from the target machine
HtmlFixedSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlFixedSaveOptions
{
    UseTargetMachineFonts = true
};
```

## Step 3: Save the Document

Now, let’s save the document as a fixed HTML file. This is where the magic happens!

```csharp
// Convert document to fixed HTML
doc.Save(dataDir + "UsingTargetMachineFonts.html", saveOptions);
```

## Step 4: Verify the Output

Finally, it’s important to verify the output. Open the saved HTML file in a web browser to check if the fonts are correctly applied from the target machine.

```csharp
// Open the HTML file to verify the output
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(dataDir + "UsingTargetMachineFonts.html");
```

And there you have it! You’ve successfully utilized fonts from the target machine in your Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Conclusion

Leveraging fonts from the target machine ensures that your Word documents look consistent and professional, regardless of where they're viewed. Aspose.Words for .NET simplifies this process, allowing you to easily load documents, configure save options, and save them with the desired font settings.
