## Import Necessary Namespaces

To utilize Aspose.Words functionalities, you need to import the required namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.PageSetup;
```

## Step 1: Load Your Document

Start by loading your document. This is the foundation for your page setup.

```csharp
// Specify the path to your document directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 2: Set the Layout Mode

The layout mode influences how the text is arranged on the page. For this example, we’ll set it to Grid Layout, which is particularly useful for documents in Asian languages.

```csharp
// Set the layout mode for the first section of the document.
doc.FirstSection.PageSetup.LayoutMode = SectionLayoutMode.Grid;
```

## Step 3: Define Characters Per Line

Maintaining uniformity in your document's appearance is crucial. Set the number of characters per line as follows:

```csharp
doc.FirstSection.PageSetup.CharactersPerLine = 30;
```

## Step 4: Define Lines Per Page

Similarly, defining the number of lines per page contributes to a consistent look throughout your document.

```csharp
doc.FirstSection.PageSetup.LinesPerPage = 10;
```

## Step 5: Save Your Document

Once you’ve configured your page layout, the last step is to save your document. This ensures that all your settings are applied correctly.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "DocumentPageSetupExample.docx");
```
