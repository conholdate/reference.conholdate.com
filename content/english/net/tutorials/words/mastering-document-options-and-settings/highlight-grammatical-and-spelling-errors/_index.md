## Introduction

Do you find yourself endlessly searching through documents for grammatical and spelling errors? It can feel like a never-ending game of "Where's Waldo"! Fortunately, Aspose.Words for .NET can automate this process, saving you time and effort. In this guide, we'll walk through how to enable grammatical and spelling error displays in your Word documents using this powerful library.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. Development Environment: Use Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with basic C# programming concepts will be helpful.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This will ensure that your code can access all the features of the Aspose.Words library.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First, create a new .NET project in your IDE. Add a reference to the Aspose.Words library. If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can do so from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).

## Step 2: Define the Document Directory

Next, set the path to your document directory. This is where your Word documents are stored.

```csharp
// Define the path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your Word documents.

## Step 3: Load Your Document

Now, load the document you want to check for errors. Aspose.Words makes this straightforward.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Document.docx");
```

Make sure that `Document.docx` exists in your specified directory.

## Step 4: Enable Error Display

This is where the magic happens! With just a couple of lines of code, you can enable the display of grammatical and spelling errors.

```csharp
doc.ShowGrammaticalErrors = true;
doc.ShowSpellingErrors = true;
```

These properties instruct Aspose.Words to highlight any grammatical and spelling mistakes in the document, similar to how Microsoft Word does.

## Step 5: Save the Modified Document

Finally, save the document to retain your changes. This will create a new file without overwriting the original.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "Document_With_Errors_Highlighted.docx");
```

You can now open this new file to see all the grammatical and spelling errors clearly highlighted.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just learned how to automate the display of grammatical and spelling errors in Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. This not only streamlines your editing process but also ensures your documents are polished and professional.
