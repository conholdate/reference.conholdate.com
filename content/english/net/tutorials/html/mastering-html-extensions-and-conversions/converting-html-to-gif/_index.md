## Introduction

Aspose.HTML for .NET is a powerful library that empowers developers to manipulate and convert HTML documents effortlessly. This tutorial will guide you through using Aspose.HTML to convert HTML to GIF, whether you're an experienced programmer or just starting your journey in web development.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

### .NET Development Environment 

Set up your development environment with Visual Studio or any preferred IDE for .NET development. You can download Visual Studio from the [website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

### Install Aspose.HTML for .NET

Get the Aspose.HTML library by downloading it from the [Aspose Downloads page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/).

### Input HTML Document

Prepare the HTML document you wish to convert and save it in your project directory.

### Basic C# Knowledge

Having a basic understanding of C# will help you navigate the examples in this guide.

With everything set, let’s explore how to convert HTML to GIF using Aspose.HTML for .NET.

## Step 1: Import Namespaces

First, include the required namespace at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
```

This allows you to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.HTML library.

## Step 2: Load the HTML Document

Load the HTML document that you want to convert. Make sure the file is located in your specified data directory:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
HTMLDocument htmlDocument = new HTMLDocument(dataDir + "input.html");
```

## Step 3: Initialize ImageSaveOptions

Set up the `ImageSaveOptions` to determine the output image format, which in this case is GIF:

```csharp
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Gif);
```

This configuration allows Aspose to save the output in the desired format.

## Step 4: Specify the Output File Path

Define where you want to save the converted GIF file:

```csharp
string outputFile = dataDir + "HTMLtoGIF_Output.gif";
```

## Step 5: Convert HTML to GIF

Finally, perform the conversion by calling the `Converter` class:

```csharp
Converter.ConvertHTML(htmlDocument, options, outputFile);
```

And that's it! You’ve successfully converted an HTML document to a GIF image.
