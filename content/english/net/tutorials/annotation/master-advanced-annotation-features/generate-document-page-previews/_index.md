This tutorial will walk you through the process of generating document page previews using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET, breaking it down into easily digestible steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following in your development environment:

### Installation of GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
Download GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).

### Development Environment Setup
Make sure your development setup includes .NET-compatible tools and libraries. Visual Studio is recommended, but you can use any IDE of your choice.

### Basic C# Knowledge
Familiarity with C# programming is essential, as this tutorial involves writing C# code to leverage GroupDocs.Annotation’s functionality.

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

Start by importing the relevant namespaces to access the functionalities of GroupDocs.Annotation:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Annotator Object

Initialize the `Annotator` object by specifying the path to the PDF file you wish to preview. 

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
{
    // Proceed to define preview options
}
```

## Step 2: Defining Preview Options

Next, configure the preview options for generating document page previews. This involves determining the format, page numbers, and output paths for the previews.

```csharp
PreviewOptions previewOptions = new PreviewOptions(pageNumber =>
{
    var pagePath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", $"result_{pageNumber}.png");
    return File.Create(pagePath);
});
```

## Step 3: Generating Document Previews

Set the desired preview format and specify which pages to include in the output. In this case, we’ll use PNG format for the first four pages.

```csharp
previewOptions.PreviewFormat = PreviewFormats.PNG;
previewOptions.PageNumbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
annotator.Document.GeneratePreview(previewOptions);
```

Call the `GeneratePreview` method to create the document previews.
