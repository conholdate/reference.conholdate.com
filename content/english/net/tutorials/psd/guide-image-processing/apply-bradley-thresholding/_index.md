## Introduction

Welcome to our tutorial on applying the Bradley Threshold technique using Aspose.PSD for .NET. This powerful library enables seamless manipulation of Photoshop files within .NET applications. Bradley Thresholding is an effective method for image binarization, which helps distinguish objects from their backgrounds.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Download and install the latest version from the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- Document Directory: Create a working directory to store your source PSD file and the output binarized image.

## Import Necessary Namespaces

Begin your project by importing the relevant namespaces to access Aspose.PSD functionalities:

```csharp
// Import Aspose.PSD namespaces
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load Your Source Image

Define the path to your document directory along with the source PSD file and the name for the output file:

```csharp
// Specify the path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

string sourceFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "sample.psd");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "binarized_out.png");
```

## Step 2: Apply the Bradley Threshold

Next, load the PSD image, choose your threshold value, apply the Bradely thresholding, and then save the results:

```csharp
// Load the PSD image
using (PsdImage image = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFile))
{
    // Set the threshold value (experiment with this value as needed)
    double threshold = 0.15;

    // Binarize the image using the Bradley method
    image.BinarizeBradley(threshold);

    // Save the binarized image in PNG format
    image.Save(outputFile, new PngOptions());
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully implemented the Bradley Threshold technique using Aspose.PSD for .NET. This method can greatly improve image segmentation for various applications, from document analysis to graphic design.
