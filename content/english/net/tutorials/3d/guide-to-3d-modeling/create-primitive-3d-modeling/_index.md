## Introduction

Welcome to the immersive world of 3D modeling using Aspose.3D for .NET! In this comprehensive tutorial, we’ll guide you through the process of creating primitive 3D models step by step. Whether you’re an experienced developer or a beginner eager to learn, this guide will empower you to create visually stunning 3D elements for your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into 3D modeling, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.3D for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.3D for .NET library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/net/).
  
- .NET Development Environment: Set up an environment compatible with Aspose.3D, such as Visual Studio.

With everything prepared, let’s embark on our 3D modeling adventure!

## Importing Required Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.3D functionalities:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.ThreeD;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Entities;
using Aspose.ThreeD.Formats;
```

These namespaces will provide you with the tools necessary to manipulate 3D models and save your creations.

## Step 1: Initialize a Scene Object

Create a new scene object that acts as the canvas for your 3D models:

```csharp
// Initialize a Scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
```

This scene will contain the primitive shapes you are about to create.

## Step 2: Create a Box Model

Next, let’s add a box model to your scene:

```csharp
// Create a Box model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("box", new Box());
```

You can customize the dimensions and properties of the box to suit your creative vision.

## Step 3: Create a Cylinder Model

Now, enhance your scene by adding a cylinder:

```csharp
// Create a Cylinder model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("cylinder", new Cylinder());
```

Just like with the box, feel free to adjust the cylinder's parameters to achieve your desired look.

## Step 4: Save the Scene in FBX Format

To preserve your 3D model, save it in the FBX format:

```csharp
// Save drawing in the FBX format
var output = Path.Combine("Your Output Directory", "test.fbx");
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

Make sure to choose an appropriate output directory and file name for your model.

## Step 5: Display a Success Message

Finally, celebrate your success by displaying a message:

```csharp
// Display success message
Console.WriteLine($"\nBuilding a scene from primitive 3D models was successful.\nFile saved at {output}");
```

Your 3D scene composed of primitive models is now complete and saved!
