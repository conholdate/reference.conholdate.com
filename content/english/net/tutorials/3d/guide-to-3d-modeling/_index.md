## Create Primitive 3D Models

Every artist needs a solid foundation, and what better way to start than by creating primitive shapes? In our tutorial on [creating primitive 3D models](./create-primitive-3d-modeling/), you’ll learn how to construct basic objects like boxes, spheres, and cylinders. These shapes are the building blocks of more complex models and are perfect for anyone just starting out.

We’ll guide you through the process step by step, breaking down each action so you can follow along easily. Imagine you're building a house. First, you lay down the foundation with simple blocks. Similarly, in our tutorial, you’ll set the ground with primitive shapes, allowing your creativity to flourish as you later customize them with textures and colors.
