## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET Library
Download the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library from the [site](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/). Follow the installation instructions to add it to your project.

## Step 1: Import Necessary Namespaces
In your .NET project, include the following namespaces to access the GroupDocs functionalities:

## Step 2: Define Output Folder and File Path
Set up the output directory where the converted PDF will be saved:

string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "md-converted-to.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Load the Source Markdown File
Load the Markdown file you wish to convert:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("path/to/your/file.md")) // Replace with your MD file path
{
    // Conversion logic will be added in the next steps
}
```

## Step 4: Set Conversion Options
Configure the options for the PDF conversion:

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

## Step 5: Perform the Conversion
Call the `Convert` method to initiate the conversion:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

## Step 6: Verify Conversion Completion
After the conversion, confirm its success with a message:
