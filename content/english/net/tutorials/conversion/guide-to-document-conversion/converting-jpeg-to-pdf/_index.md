## Introduction

In software development, converting files from one format to another is an everyday necessity. Whether it’s changing images to PDFs, documents to images, or more, a reliable conversion tool is invaluable. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is a powerful library designed to handle a wide array of file format transformations seamlessly, making it a go-to solution for developers.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, ensure you have the following set up:

### Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
You can download the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided there.

### Basic Understanding of C#
Familiarity with the C# programming language is essential, as our examples will use C# code snippets to demonstrate the conversion process.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
You’ll need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your code. Popular choices include Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.

### Source File(s) for Conversion
Make sure you have the source file(s) ready for conversion. For example, if you’re interested in converting JPEG to PDF, have your JPEG file(s) accessible.

## Importing Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Name
Determine where your converted PDF will reside, and set the name for your output file:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory"; // Specify your directory
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "jpeg-converted-to.pdf"); // Set output file name
```

## Step 2: Load the Source JPEG File
Use the `Converter` class from GroupDocs.Conversion to load your JPEG file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_JPEG))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```

## Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Define the conversion options. For converting JPEG to PDF, you'll use `PdfConvertOptions`:

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions(); // Create PDF conversion options
```

## Step 4: Execute the Conversion
Invoke the `Convert` method to execute the format change. Pass in your output file path along with the conversion options:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Perform the conversion
```

## Step 5: Display a Completion Message
Once the conversion is complete, it’s good practice to inform the user. You can add the following line:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully.\nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've walked through the process of converting JPEG images to PDF files using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By following this straightforward guide, you can effortlessly integrate file format conversion capabilities into your .NET applications.
