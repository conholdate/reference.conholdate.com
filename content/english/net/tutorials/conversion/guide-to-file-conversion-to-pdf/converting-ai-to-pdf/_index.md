## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to efficiently convert AI files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

Before we start converting files, make sure you have the following set up:

### Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

You can download GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/). Ensure you install it according to your project requirements.

### Source AI File

Have a valid AI file ready for conversion. Place it in a convenient directory within your development environment.

### Development Environment

Set up a .NET development environment (like Visual Studio) to write and execute your code.

## Import Necessary Namespaces

To utilize GroupDocs.Conversion, start by importing essential namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
These namespaces provide access to the conversion functionalities needed for our task.

## Step 1: Load the Source AI File

First, define the output directory and the output file name where the converted PDF will be saved:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory"; // Specify your document directory here
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ai-converted-to.pdf");

using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("Path to Your AI File"))
{
```

In this snippet, we create a new `Converter` instance, specifying the path to your AI file.

## Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

Next, set up any specific options you might need for the PDF conversion:

```csharp
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
By creating an instance of `PdfConvertOptions`, you can customize settings like page size, margins, and more. While this is optional, it gives you flexibility for specific requirements.

## Step 3: Perform the Conversion

Now, itâ€™s time to execute the conversion:

```csharp
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
Here, we call `Convert`, passing in the output file path and our options. This runs the conversion and saves the resulting PDF to the specified directory.

## Conclusion

With GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, converting AI files to PDF is a seamless process. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, enhancing your document management capabilities and optimizing workflows.
