## Introduction

Converting BMP images to PDF format can be essential for document management and sharing. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET provides a straightforward and effective solution for achieving this. In this article, we’ll walk you through the step-by-step process of using this library to perform the conversion seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following in place:

1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Download and install the library from the [site](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. Source BMP File: Have your BMP image file ready for conversion.

## Step 1: Import Necessary Namespaces

Begin by importing the required namespaces to make the necessary classes and methods accessible:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 2: Define Output Folder and File Name

Next, specify where you want to save the converted PDF file. Create a directory string that points to your desired output location:

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"C:\Your\Output\Directory"; // Update with your directory path
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "bmp-converted.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Load the Source BMP File

Utilize the `Converter` class to load your BMP file. Make sure to reference the correct file path:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(@"C:\Path\To\Your\Image.bmp")) // Update with your BMP file path
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```

## Step 4: Configure Conversion Options

Prepare the conversion options. For converting to PDF, use the `PdfConvertOptions` class:

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

## Step 5: Execute the Conversion

Now, it’s time to convert the BMP image to PDF format and save it in your specified location:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

## Step 6: Verify the Conversion

Once the conversion process is complete, output a confirmation message indicating success:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Conversion to PDF completed successfully. Check the output in: {outputFolder}");
```
