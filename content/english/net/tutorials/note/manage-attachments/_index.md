## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET is an incredible tool for managing and enhancing Microsoft OneNote documents. Whether you're looking to attach files, set custom icons, or optimize document management, this toolkit has got you covered. In this article, we'll dive into two essential tutorials: attaching files to OneNote documents and setting custom icons, enabling you to take your .NET application to the next level. Let’s explore these tutorials step by step and show you how to implement these powerful features seamlessly.

## Attaching Files in OneNote Documents  
Attaching files to OneNote documents is a feature that can significantly enhance your note-taking process. By embedding files directly into your OneNote pages, you ensure that all important resources are easily accessible from one place. This process is crucial when working on complex projects or team collaborations where multiple documents are referenced frequently. Aspose.Note for .NET simplifies this task with clear API methods that allow you to attach files programmatically.

To start, you'll need to load the OneNote document you want to modify and choose where the file will be attached. Once the location is set, Aspose.Note allows you to add the file, whether it’s a document, image, or any other type of file. After that, it’s just a matter of calling a few methods to ensure the file is properly embedded within the document.

## Setting Custom Icons for Attachments  
One of the standout features of Aspose.Note for .NET is the ability to set custom icons for attachments. Setting icons adds a layer of personalization and organization to your OneNote pages. Instead of using the default icons, you can replace them with something more intuitive or meaningful to your specific use case.

For example, if you're managing project documents, you could use custom icons to represent different file types or statuses. With Aspose.Note for .NET, setting an icon is as easy as specifying the image path and linking it to the attachment. This way, every time you view the document, the icon will appear beside the attachment, making it immediately recognizable.
