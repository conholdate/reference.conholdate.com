## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET is an advanced library designed for developers to create, manipulate, and convert Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. A standout feature of this library is its ability to attach files to OneNote documents and customize their icons. In this guide, we’ll explore how to leverage Aspose.Note for .NET to seamlessly attach files and set custom icons, enriching your OneNote document functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the solution, ensure you have the following:

- Development Environment: Visual Studio or a similar IDE configured for .NET development.
- Library Installation: Install the [Aspose.Note for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) library.
- Programming Knowledge: Basic understanding of C#.

## Importing Required Namespaces

Add these namespaces to your project for essential functionality:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;
```

Below is the detailed step-by-step implementation.

## Step 1: Create a New OneNote Document

Initialize a new OneNote document using the `Document` class.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 2: Add a New Page

Add a page to the document to organize your notes and attachments.

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

## Step 3: Set Up an Outline

Create an `Outline` object, which serves as the container for elements in your OneNote page.

```csharp
Outline outline = new Outline(doc);
```

## Step 4: Initialize an Outline Element

An `OutlineElement` will hold the attachment and its associated icon.

```csharp
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement(doc);
```

## Step 5: Attach a File and Specify Its Icon

Specify the file to be attached and provide an icon for it.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

using (var stream = File.OpenRead(dataDir + "icon.jpg"))
{
    AttachedFile attachedFile = new AttachedFile(doc, dataDir + "attachment.txt", stream, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
    outlineElem.AppendChildLast(attachedFile);
}
```

## Step 6: Assemble the Document Structure

Add the `OutlineElement` to the `Outline`, and the `Outline` to the `Page`.

```csharp
outline.AppendChildLast(outlineElem);
page.AppendChildLast(outline);
```

## Step 7: Add the Page to the Document

Finally, include the page in your OneNote document.

```csharp
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 8: Save the Document

Export your updated document with the file attachment and icon.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "AttachFileAndSetIcon_out.one";
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effortlessly attach files and set custom icons in OneNote documents using Aspose.Note for .NET. This functionality can greatly enhance document organization and user experience, making your applications more robust and feature-rich.
